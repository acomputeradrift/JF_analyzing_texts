[2020-11-03, 1:17:15 PM] Sien Tan: ‎Messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of this chat, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.
[2020-11-03, 1:17:15 PM] Jamie: Hey I sent you a message using iMessage yesterday when I arrived, did you get it?
[2020-11-03, 3:46:52 PM] Sien Tan: I did and responded but am guessing you didn’t get the response. Happy you arrived safely and how your shoulder is ok.
[2020-11-03, 3:52:08 PM] Jamie: Yeah I think for iMessage to work on wifi, your phone has to have the phone number and email receive the messages. It’s a setting in iMessage
‎[2020-11-03, 3:52:10 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-03, 3:52:27 PM] Jamie: But WhatsApp is fine too
[2020-11-03, 3:54:05 PM] Jamie: My shoulder... survived the flights with relatively little pain which was good. But I think I am paying for it now. I did a little physio but can’t see myself getting into the water this week until it settles down.
[2020-11-03, 4:01:49 PM] Sien Tan: Good idea to take it slow
[2020-11-03, 4:10:59 PM] Jamie: Are you interested in a phone call later? The wifi is not great but useable, and I’m already working on fixing it 🤓
[2020-11-03, 4:24:18 PM] Sien Tan: I think I turned on the right settings for iMessage now
[2020-11-03, 4:31:33 PM] Jamie: Yup!
[2020-11-03, 4:31:47 PM] Jamie: Oh wait. This is WhatsApp. Lol
[2020-11-03, 5:08:29 PM] Sien Tan: Yes definitely. Around 430 or after 830. Whatever works :)
[2020-11-03, 5:13:59 PM] Jamie: Ok. It’s 3 hours ahead here because of daylight savings ending so 8:30 your time is deep into zzzzzz for me. I’ll give ya a call around 4:30 on WhatsApp voice.
[2020-11-03, 6:20:13 PM] Sien Tan: Oh ok. Sounds good, chat soon

[2020-11-08, 8:09:52 PM] Sien Tan: I’m surprised at how much grew and more is coming...

[2020-11-09, 4:30:25 PM] Jamie: Hey what’s your schedule for this evening?
[2020-11-09, 6:40:59 PM] Sien Tan: I tried to text you but I guess it didn’t go through. I’m home after teaching. Want to chat at 7. I know it’s a bit late your time with the time difference so doesn’t have to be a long call.
[2020-11-09, 6:43:58 PM] Jamie: Yeah the iMessage doesn’t seem to be working. I sent you something yesterday too that you maybe didn’t get
[2020-11-09, 6:45:47 PM] Jamie: Ok 7 your time.
[2020-11-09, 6:50:48 PM] Sien Tan: Hmm strange. Ok, looking forward to it.
[2020-11-09, 10:03:15 PM] Jamie: Hi you around?
[2020-11-10, 12:04:11 AM] Sien Tan: Can you find out or do you know what time you were born?
[2020-11-10, 11:16:47 AM] Jamie: Morning! I sent an email to my mom, will get back to you on this.
‎[2020-11-10, 11:17:05 AM] Jamie: ‎video omitted
[2020-11-10, 11:18:48 AM] Jamie: I paddled out today! The swell was gone this morning and the sun was out so I gave it a try. Took it very easy but was able to paddle without major pain and even got up on a little wave. Felt amazing to be in the water again 😊
[2020-11-10, 11:19:14 AM] Jamie: I will see how my shoulder reacts in the next 24 hrs
[2020-11-10, 2:32:59 PM] Sien Tan: That’s so good to hear that you were in the water and it went ok. Maybe some of the fear is in your mind, which is still equally as valid. I bet things will continue to improve as your Ecuadorian journey settles and continues. I hope you continue to be cautious 😊. The place you’re staying looks beautiful, if a little tech limited and quiet.
[2020-11-10, 9:15:47 PM] Sien Tan: Remember the song hunger strike by stone temple pilots? I forgot how good it was and it’s come on a few time randomly over the past few days.
[2020-11-11, 8:17:44 AM] Jamie: Such a great song. Now it’s stuck in my head...
🎵 I don’t mind, stealing bread, from the mouth of disadennnnnnnnnnnnnts 🎵
[2020-11-11, 4:05:46 PM] Sien Tan: Hi, feels like I haven’t heard much from you the past couple days. How’d your shoulder do and how are you?
[2020-11-11, 4:33:04 PM] Jamie: Hello! We just went to a little beach bar about 20 minutes by taxi for some tacos. It was delicious and he had some bourbon!
‎[2020-11-11, 4:34:09 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-11, 4:42:33 PM] Sien Tan: Bring it back with ya
[2020-11-11, 4:51:20 PM] Jamie: Seeing a picture of you by email made want to see your beautiful self. Will you video chat with me soon?
[2020-11-11, 5:58:33 PM] Sien Tan: Yes :)
[2020-11-11, 6:00:21 PM] Sien Tan: Just realized it’s our two week gone-iversary
[2020-11-11, 7:44:48 PM] Jamie: Indeed it is. Only 11 more of these and we can be back to touching 😜
[2020-11-11, 8:09:33 PM] Jamie: What time of day is your favourite time to connect? Often I’m in my room or sleeping when you are at your end of day so we miss each other there. Earlier? At noon here I’m generally eating lunch so 9am there would work.
[2020-11-11, 11:09:03 PM] Sien Tan: I could do Saturday or Sunday am
[2020-11-12, 4:12:59 PM] Sien Tan: Hola, are you free to chat this afternoon or evening? I’ll be home between 230 and 430 and after seven.
[2020-11-12, 6:00:35 PM] Jamie: Hey there. You around?
[2020-11-12, 6:02:00 PM] Sien Tan: Yup just laying in bed. I’ll call you.

[2020-11-12, 11:49:30 PM] Sien Tan: I hope you’re having sweet dreams 😘
[2020-11-13, 8:16:25 AM] Jamie: Always, when I dream of you. Squeezing me. Lol.
[2020-11-13, 8:17:46 AM] Jamie: And good morning to you, my lovely lady.

[2020-11-13, 4:01:41 PM] Sien Tan: Ooh I like that!
[2020-11-14, 11:44:58 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning, do you know if I can do video call through WhatsApp on my iPad? The info online is conflicting
[2020-11-14, 11:55:07 AM] Jamie: If it has a phone number, yes. Under an account with that phone umber.
[2020-11-14, 11:56:01 AM] Jamie: But otherwise I don’t think so
[2020-11-14, 11:59:56 AM] Sien Tan: Oki doki I’m just trying to set up the phone on a stand so I do t have to hold. Will be ready soon.
[2020-11-14, 12:01:06 PM] Jamie: No problem. It does look like you can use your iPad just through the browser. It will give you a QR code to scan with your phone so that you can use it on your iPad. If I remember correctly, it doesn’t offer video but that could’ve changed

[2020-11-14, 7:21:54 PM] Jamie: Have you tried any?
[2020-11-14, 7:22:12 PM] Jamie: Also, we are talking about natural deodorants. What do you use?
[2020-11-14, 7:22:34 PM] Jamie: A girl here uses coconut oil, baking soda and corn starch
[2020-11-14, 8:29:07 PM] Sien Tan: I use a couple different ones. One is charcoal with essential oils.
[2020-11-14, 8:29:42 PM] Sien Tan: Haven’t tried them yet. Maybe next week will be my experiment with mushrooms week 😬
[2020-11-14, 9:10:58 PM] Jamie: Haha if your eye goes wonky, I want a picture 😉
[2020-11-14, 10:27:00 PM] Jamie: Good night, my beautiful Sien. I thought of you so many times today and each time I Buddha smiled.
[2020-11-14, 10:27:21 PM] Jamie: Even with a turtle neck I saw part I wanted to devour. 😋
[2020-11-14, 10:58:43 PM] Sien Tan: Xoxo sweet dreams Jamie Feeny
[2020-11-15, 11:19:12 AM] Sien Tan: Safe travels today!
[2020-11-15, 11:25:20 AM] Jamie: Thanks...and good morning to you
[2020-11-15, 11:33:03 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning...picked mushrooms this AM
‎[2020-11-15, 11:33:13 AM] Sien Tan: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-15, 11:34:27 AM] Jamie: Holy cow. Have you weighed what you picked so far? I’m curious
[2020-11-15, 1:55:57 PM] Sien Tan: I weighed the dried ones. Once they’re dry not much. About 3 oz
[2020-11-15, 3:41:19 PM] Jamie: That almost 90 grams!
[2020-11-15, 3:42:07 PM] Jamie: Made it to Montanita now and I’m set up in my cabana here for the next 16 days. Start my Spanish lessons  tomorrow at 10am
[2020-11-15, 4:20:38 PM] Sien Tan: That’ll last me a bit ;) That sounds like fun! How long are you in montanita for? I’m doing dental hygiene learning stuff with Roxanne and it’s boring af, lol. Off to have my teeth cleaned soon 😬
[2020-11-15, 10:21:39 PM] Jamie: Hope your teeth cleaning wasn’t too scary...
[2020-11-15, 10:53:20 PM] Jamie: Night!
[2020-11-15, 10:54:30 PM] Sien Tan: Good night Jamie ✨
[2020-11-16, 11:27:31 AM] Sien Tan: Hey handsome, hope you’re like a sponge this morning and learning lots and having fun. I’m missing you.
[2020-11-16, 12:53:17 PM] Jamie: Miss you too Sien. This morning I was walking around Montanita and wishing you were here so I can show you all of the neat things. Like the giant iguanas sun tanning way up in the trees, the best fresh baked chocolate croissants etc.
[2020-11-16, 12:53:51 PM] Jamie: Class was tiring. Speaking only Spanish for 2 hours hurts my brain still
‎[2020-11-16, 2:49:40 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-16, 4:07:08 PM] Sien Tan: Wish I was there too. Great little quote; it resonates. I was walking around thinking do you too. Found a great piece of driftwood in a second hand store. Not sure if the picture does it justice.
‎[2020-11-16, 4:07:18 PM] Sien Tan: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-16, 4:09:20 PM] Jamie: Lol. That is the most mom picture ever, haha
[2020-11-16, 4:37:58 PM] Sien Tan: I’m reading Bruce Lipton‘s book, the biology of belief and have just come to understand something in the most mind blowing way and have to share! Science used to think that everything was made up of matter and that the smallest of these particles was an atom. Newtonian physics, and what were taught in highschool, was that everything is made up of atoms that spin around each other to form a physical structure. What quantum physics has now proven is that atoms are made of vortices of energy. If we could see this under a microscope, it would resemble a tornado-like vortex. From far away it would look like I blurry dust cloud, but as you got closer, the dust cloud would disappear. Where you would intend to be observing an atom, you would actually observe a physical void, aka nothing . The atom has no physical structure. So while  our mind believes things to exist in solid form, like the phone I’m writing on, from a quantum science perspective, it doesn’t actually exist in the form we think it does! That is completely mind bending and I’m so curious to understand more about how energy, like thoughts, emotions and feelings can impact the things that we believe to be so solid, including the human body! If I went back to school I would definitely take a degree in quantum physics. Maybe that’s what I want to be when I grow up. Thanks for listening, I’m very excited 😊
[2020-11-16, 4:44:29 PM] Jamie: What a wonderful thing, to be so excited when you read something! And a scientific explanation for things that you believe, but maybe have taken in faith. Does he talk about quantum entanglement? That a mind bender
[2020-11-16, 4:48:57 PM] Sien Tan: Yes, so invigorating as it feels like I’m melting to worlds that I existent almost equally. The scientific and the spiritual. Or the material and the energetic. Or the mind and the heart. Feels like there is are coming together of opposites or what are used to think were opposing. My heart just feels so happy right now! Quantum entanglement? Not yet…
[2020-11-16, 4:56:34 PM] Jamie: 😊
[2020-11-16, 9:56:25 PM] Jamie: I can’t wait for you to try your mushrooms. That will be so cool. I’ve actually never known anyone to successfully grow them
[2020-11-16, 10:18:48 PM] Sien Tan: I have 3 kinds to try :) I’ll let you know if I notice a difference. Think the micro dosing has been helpful.
[2020-11-17, 3:35:36 PM] Jamie: Hi sexy. Any time in the next day or two you are available to chat?
[2020-11-17, 4:10:26 PM] Sien Tan: Hey handsome, I can chat today or tomorrow. I’ll be home today after 230. What’s your schedule?
[2020-11-17, 4:11:43 PM] Sien Tan: Actually home at 330 today
[2020-11-17, 4:14:09 PM] Jamie: I have to head to Olón for 6pm or 3 your time. To drink beer. So maybe you will get a call from drunk me.
[2020-11-17, 4:14:48 PM] Jamie: And tomorrow what’s your schedule after 9am your time?
[2020-11-17, 4:16:24 PM] Sien Tan: I can make 9 work tomorrow. Might be in my pjs...
[2020-11-17, 4:17:27 PM] Jamie: That suits me perfectly 😜
[2020-11-17, 4:18:12 PM] Jamie: I’m done my class at 9am PST so it will be a little later. 10-15 min
[2020-11-17, 4:34:46 PM] Sien Tan: Sure :) I heard there’s a hurricane down your way. Does it impact Ecuador at all?
[2020-11-17, 4:46:25 PM] Jamie: I don’t think Ecuador gets hurricanes. But I will check it out. Sounds like great 🏄🏻‍♂️
[2020-11-17, 4:48:04 PM] Jamie: Interesting looks like there is one in él salvador right now which is a couple thousand kilometres above us.
[2020-11-17, 4:54:12 PM] Sien Tan: Happy to hear it’s not close even if it would make for good surf

[2020-11-17, 9:10:46 PM] Jamie: Do you have a better one? Maybe in a sweater dress?
[2020-11-17, 10:54:37 PM] Jamie: Good night, my love. My dreams will be filled with visions of  you when we went out to dinner at Earls.
[2020-11-18, 12:07:52 PM] Jamie: Hello!
[2020-11-18, 12:09:03 PM] Sien Tan: Hey handsome. Ready for a chat?
[2020-11-18, 12:09:48 PM] Jamie: Yup yup. Video? 🤓
[2020-11-18, 12:10:28 PM] Sien Tan: Just out of shower but oki doki. Let me set up phone stand and I’ll call you
[2020-11-18, 12:10:39 PM] Jamie: 👍
‎[2020-11-19, 1:26:35 AM] Sien Tan: ‎video omitted
[2020-11-20, 8:02:15 PM] Jamie: Hi Sien, I am working on the understanding that you asked for space. Is that correct?
[2020-11-20, 8:52:49 PM] Sien Tan: I think we both wanted some space? I did respond to your email and I’m not sure how to navigate this.
[2020-11-20, 8:55:12 PM] Jamie: Weird. It just came in. I had set it to VIP but it didn’t notify me
[2020-11-20, 9:03:26 PM] Jamie: I am having a really hard time giving you the space to be confused. I’m sorry. I am hyper sensitive right now, and I really am scared of losing you. Thank you for saying that you still want to be with me. I should know, but I need this reassurance.
[2020-11-20, 9:07:32 PM] Jamie: I think my defensiveness stems something that hurt me deeply before I left. I can’t forget it and I keep returning to it and it drives me towards the idea that you are half out the door.
[2020-11-20, 9:28:25 PM] Jamie: Your decision to stop sleeping with me hurt. I have tried to understand and I have inquired several times, but nothing I heard made sense. Maybe you don’t know. But I’ve realize that it may be at the core of my insecurities. It may be why each time I sense your confusion, feel the space you are trying to use to figure things out, I panic.
[2020-11-20, 9:32:50 PM] Jamie: And I thought I was responding to you bringing up these challenges and difficulties you were having with curiousity. In the only way I could figure out to do. I sent specific questions about what you were struggling with and I never got answers. Space, I agree, I’m not very good at it.
[2020-11-20, 9:34:14 PM] Jamie: I’m trying to provide context for my mindset, for my actions, but it sounds defensive and I wish I could change that.
[2020-11-20, 9:56:13 PM] Sien Tan: I’m sorry I can’t give you more context as to why I didn’t want to sleep together before you left other than what I shared at the time. Sex is a place of vulnerability for me and when I was preparing myself for you moving, I couldn’t put myself in the space of being open and vulnerable enough to want to have sex. I was feeling scared and sad and navigated it the best I could. I’m not sure how I was supposed to act the same when everything was about to change. Maybe that’s just me and I’m sorry it hurt you. 

I’ve tried to share more about my struggles with you, like on our phone call. I’m not sure how to share them in a way that will feel less personal or trigger less defensiveness. 

Really I just wanted to be heard and understood, even if you see things differently or don’t agree. 

Thank you for sharing how it feels when you sense my confusion and where you think it stems from. I know we’re both doing the best we can. It just feels a bit hard right now I feel lost as to how to make it different.
[2020-11-20, 10:22:55 PM] Jamie: Sien, in the most gentle and loving way, I want to suggest that we think, and make a decision together, about not continuing this long distance relationship. If you’re unsure, and you have every right to feel this way, I think it’s going to tear us apart, perhaps faster than we can learn to navigate.
[2020-11-20, 10:51:01 PM] Sien Tan: To be clear, are you suggesting we think about ending it now and try to navigate the ending together?
[2020-11-20, 10:55:50 PM] Jamie: Yes, I am suggesting we think about ending it now. It’s an option we haven’t talked about.
[2020-11-20, 11:07:49 PM] Sien Tan: Ok, can I think about it for a few days? I’m scared to end it but maybe it’s an option we should consider. I sense that you don’t want to sit in the unknown of where things will go.
[2020-11-20, 11:22:49 PM] Jamie: I don’t think I can sit in the unknown. Without a solid feeling of commitment, it’s too painful for me. 

Of course, take the time you need.
[2020-11-20, 11:25:52 PM] Sien Tan: How does solid commitment look different to you than how I’m showing up now?
[2020-11-21, 12:08:08 AM] Jamie: I’m not happy with what took me 35 minutes to write and I would like more time to think about this. I feel like we were able to hear each other tonight and I couldn’t find a way to stay in the spirit of that.
[2020-11-21, 12:11:16 AM] Jamie: Mostly I just want to feel like you believe in us enough to give it your all.
[2020-11-21, 11:11:02 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning, I’m not sure why your messages didn’t come in until this morning as it looks like you sent them last night?
[2020-11-21, 11:12:03 AM] Jamie: Morning! Yeah I did, but passed out 2 minutes later, haha
[2020-11-21, 11:12:36 AM] Jamie: Before anything else I want ask how things are going with the yoga classes and other lockdown stuff. Are you ok?
[2020-11-21, 11:13:11 AM] Sien Tan: I was feeling really angry and frustrated as I am confused how you went from you saying you thought we could work through this to you think we should consider breaking up. I looked for inspiration from Tara and I’m wondering if you’d be open to listening to the talk that I serendipitously picked and spending some time remembering what we love about each other and us?
[2020-11-21, 11:16:39 AM] Jamie: I would be honoured. I was going to ask for some help with maybe videos that talk specifically about relationships.
[2020-11-21, 11:21:32 AM] Sien Tan: Whatever we decide together I want it to be with as much love for ourselves and each other as humanly possible and I think spending time remember why was want to be together or what we appreciate is a good place to start ❤️ https://youtu.be/Bf9DdVoE-iw
[2020-11-21, 11:22:37 AM] Sien Tan: Roxanne’s got her results last night; covid negative and the classes at the gym have stopped. But otherwise all good.
[2020-11-21, 11:37:53 AM] Jamie: I will watch this right now. 

I feel very out of my element and childlike in my communication skills
[2020-11-21, 12:27:29 PM] Sien Tan: I feel the same sometimes. Reminds me of the first joke she tell.
[2020-11-21, 12:52:02 PM] Jamie: Love is so connected to sadness for me. When I think about what I love about you, I want to cry. And I don’t know why
[2020-11-21, 1:40:21 PM] Sien Tan: Such an interesting awareness. Have you always felt like this when you think of me?
[2020-11-21, 1:43:00 PM] Jamie: I don’t think it is specifically you. I think when there is a depth to my loving thoughts, I can’t tell the feelings from sadness. Perhaps just so much emotion that it clouds my ability to see the difference.
[2020-11-21, 3:03:50 PM] Sien Tan: I wanted to understand your experience a bit more and found this article interesting ❤️
https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/daring-love/201908/deep-sadness-can-deepen-love
[2020-11-21, 4:33:10 PM] Jamie: Thank you for this article.
[2020-11-21, 4:36:26 PM] Jamie: I forgot for a while that my insecurities are my own and not caused by your behaviour. 

While I am good at figuring out whats beneath them, I struggle asking for your help without blaming and accusing.
[2020-11-21, 7:28:07 PM] Sien Tan: I’d like us to try and sort through this together, with the intention of making it work. I know it won’t always be easy but I wouldn’t want to do hard with anyone else.
[2020-11-21, 7:52:12 PM] Jamie: Thank you Sien, for voicing this. It means so much to me to hear it. I would also like to try to sort through this together. When I did my list of things I love about Sien, it was way too long to give up on 😉
[2020-11-21, 7:54:49 PM] Jamie: Could I ask you to please remind me every once in a while that you still feel this way?
[2020-11-21, 8:24:36 PM] Sien Tan: Absolutely
[2020-11-21, 9:37:49 PM] Jamie: Are you at home tonight?
[2020-11-21, 9:48:50 PM] Sien Tan: I’m home
[2020-11-21, 9:50:08 PM] Jamie: Is there still snow? I’m just trying to get a picture of you in my mind, heating blanket in your lap, snow on the tree through the window. 😊

[2020-11-21, 9:54:24 PM] Jamie: Well 2 out of 3 isn’t bad. Creature of habit, you...
[2020-11-21, 10:10:51 PM] Jamie: I just got your email. Sien, there is no way that your sharing of these things will scare me away. It’s the opposite. I love messy you. What scares me is closed you. But right now I’m not scared, I’m honoured.
[2020-11-21, 10:24:52 PM] Jamie: I see questions in your email and I would like to pay more attention to these opportunities and give you answers. They might be rhetorical though... I also often put questions in these emails and would really like some insight. I ask for a reason and maybe you do too.
[2020-11-21, 11:12:44 PM] Sien Tan: ❤️
[2020-11-22, 12:56:29 AM] Sien Tan: I do want answers and to know more about you
‎[2020-11-22, 11:33:17 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-22, 11:48:35 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning, how are you today?
[2020-11-22, 11:49:22 AM] Sien Tan: Yes, I would love answers to the questions and to know how you things we can learn from the bump in the road.
[2020-11-22, 12:17:54 PM] Jamie: I did get your responses. Just wondering if my messages came in delayed.
[2020-11-22, 12:19:00 PM] Jamie: Morning! I’m great. I solved some problems with my program that I have been fighting with for 3 weeks! And now I am going to go for a hike with Gijs, the guy that runs the Spanish school. And the suns out!
‎[2020-11-22, 12:19:08 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-22, 12:22:55 PM] Sien Tan: The message came in last night :) Amazing photo...those iguanas 😍. If spend all my life looking at the wildlife. I’m going to work out and put up Christmas lights and decos. The sun is out here too☀️
‎[2020-11-22, 4:31:06 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-22, 4:49:34 PM] Sien Tan: Oooh did you pet them?
[2020-11-22, 4:49:59 PM] Jamie: Haha no! I’m afraid of them.
[2020-11-22, 4:50:29 PM] Sien Tan: Fair, they look pretty scary 😉
[2020-11-22, 4:50:39 PM] Jamie: And they are huge!

[2020-11-22, 4:51:58 PM] Sien Tan: That’s beautiful, send it in snail mail

[2020-11-22, 5:10:08 PM] Jamie: Is that going to be your Christmas tree?!? Tinsel (biodegradable, of course) from top to bottom?
[2020-11-22, 5:20:59 PM] Sien Tan: I’ll put one up inside too!
[2020-11-22, 7:23:06 PM] Sien Tan: ‎Missed video call

[2020-11-23, 11:09:02 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning, I needed that evening with you last night more than I knew. Hope you make a great Monday :) what are your plans this week? My classes have moved to online, so I’ll teach from home which is awesome. I’m going to attempt Costco tomorrow (bringing the mum for her handicap parking pass and great company ;) and going to the animal sanctuary with jade on Wednesday. Would love a video chat Thursday am if you’re free.
[2020-11-23, 11:11:02 AM] Jamie: Good morning.  It’s already a great Monday! I slept like I was in a coma and then went for an impromptu surf just now. It was exactly what I needed for my shoulder
[2020-11-23, 11:11:18 AM] Jamie: This is insane btw
[2020-11-23, 11:13:40 AM] Jamie: This week should be pretty casual. I would like to surf each day just a little bit following the tide. No Spanish lessons and I’m hoping to finalize the apartment. My days are open. Thursday am so 9 ish?
[2020-11-23, 11:14:47 AM] Jamie: Are the global ones filling up on the online positions for your old classes?
[2020-11-23, 11:28:14 AM] Sien Tan: I love to think about you surfing 🏄‍♂️ very sexy. Can you drone yourself and send for spank bank material? Does this apartment line up with an abundance mentality or are you more worried that you won’t find something better? Yes same schedule as the in house classes. I hope people sign up or they’ll be cancelled. People like in house more but 6 people this am.
[2020-11-23, 6:30:11 PM] Jamie: I have been trying to get drone video of me for years!
[2020-11-23, 6:31:42 PM] Jamie: I think the apartment will be peaceful and the location is beautiful. It’s the 2nd nicest one I’ve ever looked at here so not much chance of finding something better. I’m just cheap, haha
‎[2020-11-23, 6:31:59 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-23, 6:59:52 PM] Sien Tan: Did you just send me a cock pic?
[2020-11-23, 7:00:59 PM] Jamie: Yes, yes I did.
[2020-11-23, 7:02:44 PM] Jamie: Hey when do you want to chat on Thursday? I’m looking to surf at 2pm here so 11 your time.
[2020-11-23, 7:18:15 PM] Sien Tan: Sorry I meant to respond to your question earlier. 9am or 7pm. Whatever’s better for you.
[2020-11-23, 8:47:26 PM] Jamie: 9am PST is perfect. That gives us lots of time and I can still surf.
[2020-11-23, 10:46:44 PM] Jamie: How did yoga classes go?
[2020-11-24, 11:11:58 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning, it’s so strange, your messages aren’t coming in til like a day later...my morning class was great. Still had 9 people sign up. The evening was only 2 people and that’s because 1 guy instagrammed me and asked if I was teaching anywhere else’s and I told him about online. I wonder if some people don’t even know it’s available live online? Also the even class was really hard to teach and do all the poses and I think I over did it yesterday and my body is rebelling. Tell me about you..did you secure your place and how’s your arm feeling with surfing?
[2020-11-24, 11:13:32 AM] Jamie: I wondered about the messages delay. Very weird, because it says they are delivered.
[2020-11-24, 11:14:38 AM] Jamie: Maybe she can send an email out telling people at Global about the online classes. Seems a good way to keep people connected to Global and not cancelling their passes.
[2020-11-24, 11:16:14 AM] Jamie: Haven’t secured my place yet, still waiting to hear back about seeing it, but another 2 have popped up. I will look at one today and one tomorrow.
[2020-11-24, 11:17:22 AM] Jamie: My shoulder seems to be doing well. I actual my felt muscle soreness (like after a workout) on top, which is a good thing because it means I was able to use it enough to get this type of sore.
[2020-11-24, 11:17:59 AM] Jamie: Did you sleep well after your long day yesterday?
[2020-11-24, 11:21:51 AM] Sien Tan: I slept ok. Had some really weird dreams. That’s great to hear about your shoulder. Sounds like sex is the culprit for re-injury. We’ll have to cure that. I put up my inside tree last night and had the candles lit and Frank Sinatra Christmas music on. This in one of my fave times of year and I wished your were here to experience it with me.
[2020-11-24, 11:22:43 AM] Sien Tan: I think they sent out a newsletter email update but if people are like me they don’t read them🤷🏻‍♀️
[2020-11-24, 11:23:50 AM] Jamie: I saw your beautiful pictures on Instagram and wanted to be naked on the couch with you in the light of the tree...
[2020-11-24, 11:24:47 AM] Sien Tan: Maybe virtually one night...
[2020-11-24, 11:25:03 AM] Sien Tan: I just read that all yoga studios have now closed...
[2020-11-24, 11:26:19 AM] Jamie: I’m happy that you are in a position that this doesn’t hurt you too much financially. Not awesome but you are not one paycheque away from homeless either.
[2020-11-24, 11:27:29 AM] Jamie: How is Jade doing with all this?
[2020-11-24, 11:30:57 AM] Sien Tan: Yes, I actually feel so blessed. Sounds funny Given the circumstances but it’s true. It’s definitely a financial hardship in some ways especially since I am not comfortable renting a room out but I will definitely get through it and be better mentally for having had the experience. It feels like it’s strengthening my resilience and tolerance for being with the unexpected and in the unknown.
[2020-11-24, 11:32:35 AM] Sien Tan: Jade is doing well. She still working… I think one of her biggest struggles is that she works with an anti-mask or a pro Trump girl who complains about to conspiracy theories constantly. Jade and I are going to the animal sanctuary tomorrow. Is it nice not to have Spanish lessons?
[2020-11-24, 11:35:47 AM] Jamie: I’m not sure I would do well keeping my mouth shut, lol. Good for her for managing it. What a pleasure it will be to share that with her! I was going to ask if you are seeing her, I remember now you mentioned it.
[2020-11-24, 11:37:42 AM] Jamie: It’s nice not to have Spanish lessons in some ways. For some reason I dread going there, enjoy it for about 1.5 hrs the. I’m dying to go, haha. I’m so spoiled with my time. But the mornings are much longer without that to break it up.

[2020-11-24, 11:40:24 AM] Sien Tan: I feel the same way sometimes. I feel pressured when there structure or something I have to do then I kind of miss it when it’s gone. I listened to an excellent talk yesterday. It’s by the holistic psychologist and Lewis Howes and addresses why when we’re in the heat of the moment it can be hard to act from the new way of being. Would you be up for it sometime?
[2020-11-24, 11:40:40 AM] Sien Tan: That’s so cute. Is it alive?
[2020-11-24, 11:41:04 AM] Jamie: Yup. He was wandering around lost on my table at the coffee shop
[2020-11-24, 11:41:39 AM] Jamie: I love it when you send me stuff. It helps me understand you and there is benefit for myself.
[2020-11-24, 11:43:04 AM] Sien Tan: Interesting. What area do you think you struggle the most in giving and receiving respect?
[2020-11-24, 11:44:01 AM] Sien Tan: I obviously struggle the most with respecting physical space since I can’t keep my hands off you 😅
[2020-11-24, 11:48:50 AM] Jamie: When I look at this, I think I can improve in all areas. That’s why I liked it. As a reminder of some principles to uphold. The only one that I don’t worry about it the physical side of the safety one. But if I had to pick one, I have a hard time giving trust and receiving honesty
[2020-11-24, 11:49:57 AM] Sien Tan: But for real...if I was triggered I think I struggle with communicating openly and honestly sometimes. But it’s in a really subtle way. Like I think I’m being open and honest but if I could take away any need to protect myself there would be an even deeper honesty. And maybe I have trouble listening if I’m reactivity. Like logical thought goes out the window and I feel cut off from the event and the person.
[2020-11-24, 11:52:38 AM] Sien Tan: They’ve done a couple together but this one hit home for me. Maybe we can chat about it...https://youtu.be/knVfc_B0W6E
[2020-11-24, 11:54:48 AM] Jamie: I will watch it later this afternoon. I’m going to go for lunch now and won’t have wifi. 😘

Ps just to be sure, given the weird messaging delays, did you get my two emails from Sunday?
[2020-11-24, 11:55:28 AM] Sien Tan: I did and will reply later today
[2020-11-24, 11:56:00 AM] Jamie: No hurry. Just wanted to make that’s working
[2020-11-24, 11:56:29 AM] Jamie: Added to my spreadsheet. 🤓
[2020-11-24, 11:57:13 AM] Sien Tan: Lol have a good lunch. I’m going to Costco to try snd buy tp.
[2020-11-24, 12:00:52 PM] Jamie: I love you, Sien. Kind of a stupid amount to be honest
[2020-11-24, 4:09:27 PM] Sien Tan: Love you back Jamie Feeny
[2020-11-24, 9:01:53 PM] Sien Tan: I have a story that’ll make you smile. At Costco my mum kept getting stuck to the nettle shelves. She had a strong magnetic broach on and when she’d lean over to look at something she’d get sucked in and I’d have to pull her off. Good laughs 🤣. Hope you had a good day ❤️
[2020-11-24, 9:04:02 PM] Jamie: I’m glad you had a good time with your mom.
[2020-11-24, 10:19:40 PM] Jamie: Good night!
[2020-11-24, 10:42:26 PM] Sien Tan: Good night handsome 😘

[2020-11-25, 6:46:21 PM] Jamie: Did you enjoy the day with her?
[2020-11-25, 6:47:01 PM] Sien Tan: So much. Hearts full. Wish you were here.
[2020-11-25, 10:28:55 PM] Jamie: Me too! Hey did you get an invite for the shared notes?
[2020-11-25, 10:51:47 PM] Sien Tan: No I haven’t. I’ve been checking to see if you added me back.
[2020-11-26, 7:40:51 AM] Jamie: https://www.icloud.com/notes/0rI4vQ5LTMPsyKhLTILck1T4Q#Stories_with_Sien

[2020-11-26, 3:02:52 PM] Sien Tan: This guys good https://youtu.be/4H-6HTKNgV0
[2020-11-26, 3:51:51 PM] Jamie: That was odd. I couldn’t get over the reflection in his glasses
[2020-11-26, 4:44:02 PM] Jamie: How do find these super relevant video? This one is amazing.
[2020-11-26, 4:55:04 PM] Sien Tan: I find when I really need something, it shows up without searching. Maybe the belief that I’m always supported in my growth helps too 🤷🏻‍♀️? Happy you found it useful.
[2020-11-26, 5:13:19 PM] Jamie: I did. Not done yet but I can’t help but think of you and Nicole when they are talking about saying no and not apologizing.
[2020-11-26, 9:41:49 PM] Sien Tan: Yes she’s definitely helping me with learning to set boundaries. I think that I had to let go the attachment to what would happen to our friendship in order to be ok with saying no to her. Not sure if that makes sense. How are you with setting boundaries?
[2020-11-26, 9:41:58 PM] Sien Tan: And how was surfing this afternoon?
[2020-11-26, 9:55:06 PM] Jamie: It makes sense. I would imagine it’s not easy to say no to her.  I think, for myself, with my long time friendships like Morgan there are few boundaries. I almost always at yea to Morgan because in a more separate time, he was there.  As he changes and we don’t sync as much, I say yes out of loyalty.
[2020-11-26, 9:55:37 PM] Jamie: Say yes*
[2020-11-26, 9:57:09 PM] Jamie: Surfing was so good. I had some pain, then not, then some but afterward (I lay down) it was manageable and barely noticed tonight.  And I really felt like I exercised my shoulder for an over all benefit.
[2020-11-26, 10:58:36 PM] Sien Tan: I watched The video of the apartment you looked at for rent again and I agree it has a good feel to it
[2020-11-27, 10:03:34 AM] Jamie: Good morning.  Today I miss your sexy body and wish that I could give you one of my massages that are not innocent at all. 😘
[2020-11-27, 10:40:18 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning? Your massages never start innocently? 😉
[2020-11-27, 10:41:03 AM] Jamie: Full disclosure: No
[2020-11-27, 11:55:41 AM] Jamie: Got the apartment for the 1st! $400 until he adds air conditioning and then $450. Stoked!!
[2020-11-27, 12:01:25 PM] Jamie: I was getting frustrated that he wasn’t responding so I sent him a message saying I was anxious to nail down an apartment and that it felt like he wasn’t that interested in renting it because he wasn’t responding. Had he changed his mind? I wanted to tell him how I felt, without trying to manipulate him into giving me what I wanted or threatening to close on another apartment.
[2020-11-27, 12:02:59 PM] Jamie: And it worked. He responded back immediately and said sorry really busy, good to go. I could feel myself thinking of ways to word it to control the outcome. Man, that was tough to make a decision to let it go
[2020-11-27, 12:14:40 PM] Sien Tan: So great that you got the place you wanted and used the opportunity to show up and trust 💜. Sounds like the universe has your back 😘
‎[2020-11-27, 2:45:24 PM] Sien Tan: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-27, 5:05:44 PM] Jamie: Proud mama! Haha. They are beautiful in their way
[2020-11-28, 9:01:21 AM] Sien Tan: My mum went into hospital last night. She got really sick and her bp shot up. I’m hoping it’s the new meds they put her on. I’m afraid it’s something more. I was having a dream and the last thing I remember was the word love painted on the floor in a garage, then I woke up. I never go to the kitchen I’m the night and I never look at my phone but for some reason I did and saw my mum had been calling and needed help. I had a dream earlier this year that my mum would die within 5 months after Sagira. That’s about now. Her body has been through so much and it’s sad to watch her struggle. I’m so sad that she seemed to finally be going through a good stretch, now this. I’m having so many feels right now. I’m sad, scared, mad. I hate this. Part of me wants this over for her.
[2020-11-28, 9:04:47 AM] Jamie: Oh Sien, what a stressful way to wake up. I would feel so helpless in your position. What can I do to support you?
[2020-11-28, 9:05:10 AM] Jamie: I’m here if you want to call
[2020-11-28, 9:08:21 AM] Sien Tan: I don’t want to talk but thank you. I just needed to share all the feelings.
[2020-11-28, 9:10:21 AM] Jamie: Ok. I am sending good thoughts and energy to you and your mom right now. 💕
[2020-11-28, 12:51:16 PM] Jamie: Hi Sien. Any news?
[2020-11-28, 12:53:56 PM] Sien Tan: Not much new other than she’s been admitted. Likely same thing that happened in the spring...a bowel obstruction. They’ll put a tube into her stomach and see if it clears on it’s own. If not then surfer. Thanks for caring 💜
[2020-11-28, 5:35:46 PM] Sien Tan: Just wanted to give you an update. She’s still in emerg. But should be in a room somewhere soon. Not much change. I can’t go see her which is probably good. I’ll bring her some requested items later including cell phone charger and a warm sweater. Hospitals are always so cold.
[2020-11-28, 5:37:16 PM] Jamie: Thank you for the update. How are you?
[2020-11-28, 5:44:05 PM] Sien Tan: I’m ok. Processing stuff that’s coming up. Notice how much my mums life long battle with constant crisis has impacted my ability to want to be close with others. Just when I get used to her doing well or being ok, something like this happens. I can remember it from the time I was little and think it’s a big contributor to why I prefer to be on my own. I learned it wasn’t safe to rely on anyone else. It’s why I have trouble asking for/accepting/wanting help. I was just thinking to myself yesterday that she seemed to be doing so well and now this. It’s a rollercoaster and while I’m getting better at not riding the ups and downs it still feels taxing and brings up uncomfortable stuff.
[2020-11-28, 5:53:42 PM] Jamie: It sounds like it would be a lot to try to sort through when you were much younger. Even now, I hear that it is hard on you. You amaze me with your strength but I worry about you too. I love you.
[2020-11-28, 5:58:52 PM] Sien Tan: Thanks for the love and care 🥰

[2020-11-28, 7:31:29 PM] Jamie: Awww I’m glad you enjoyed it. It was so darn cute, I thought you would appreciate
[2020-11-28, 7:31:53 PM] Sien Tan: I’m packing up my moms hospital bag and it feels so familiar and I feel so angry and then I feel like anger is such a futile emotion to have right now and then I just feel tired
[2020-11-28, 7:34:04 PM] Jamie: I didn’t realize how much you have been taking care of your mom in the last years. I have only seen a fairly calm part of it
[2020-11-28, 7:40:35 PM] Sien Tan: It’s off and on and probably feels more intense when it happens. This year she’s been in hospital 3 or 4 times. I think I’m just done with crying tears that feel so familiar.
[2020-11-28, 8:23:09 PM] Jamie: Hey you said you are busy tomorrow day time, do you wanna chat in the morning? Or does the next day work better?
[2020-11-28, 10:00:45 PM] Sien Tan: I can chat tomorrow eve or another day this week
[2020-11-28, 10:02:04 PM] Jamie: Ok let’s try tomorrow night.  How did it go?
[2020-11-28, 11:09:17 PM] Sien Tan: Sounds good. I think I’ll be home late afternoon so let me know what time works for you.  It’s been an up and down day. Dropped some stuff off for her at hospital but can’t go in.
[2020-11-29, 1:43:03 PM] Sien Tan: Hey, some small changes for the good for Mum. Fingers crossed, the next couple days will tell if surgery needed.
[2020-11-29, 1:43:56 PM] Jamie: I’m happy to hear this , Sien  🤞

[2020-11-29, 2:03:33 PM] Sien Tan: He’s so handsome, or she’s so beautiful 😍
[2020-11-29, 2:04:40 PM] Jamie: I was happy with the visit. He hung out for a bit and just stared at me. Probably thought I was cute
[2020-11-29, 4:31:25 PM] Sien Tan: She’s got good taste ;)
[2020-11-29, 8:23:19 PM] Sien Tan: Hey handsome do you  still want to chat tonight?
[2020-11-29, 8:25:39 PM] Jamie: You bet. Just got home from dinner. I was going to call you at 7pm PST. Will that work?
[2020-11-29, 8:56:40 PM] Sien Tan: Yep chat then
[2020-11-30, 1:39:02 AM] Sien Tan: This was my bedtime laugh 😂 https://youtu.be/s3lVwA8EIGo
[2020-11-30, 11:34:11 AM] Jamie: Morning. I gave my sister your number, she’s hoping to chat with you about micro dosing. Hope that’s ok
[2020-11-30, 11:40:08 AM] Sien Tan: Totally ok. I have some mushroom for her too lol

[2020-11-30, 11:40:48 AM] Jamie: I can’t believe how much you got so far. Total weight?
[2020-11-30, 11:41:13 AM] Jamie: My little drug queen👸 haha
[2020-11-30, 11:51:07 AM] Sien Tan: That’s just one strain too. I’m keeping them separate so I can tell the difference in the potency and effect. The other strain isn’t as prolific. All together about 4-5 oz maybe? I’ll have to add up my totals plus the scale I’m using sucks. I should probably order another one so I can be a proper drug dealer.

[2020-11-30, 11:51:53 AM] Jamie: Goals!
[2020-11-30, 11:52:46 AM] Sien Tan: It’s weird I’m not getting notifications when WhatsApp messages come in any more and I’ve looked at the settings. I used to and nothings changed 🤷🏻‍♀️. Any thoughts?
[2020-11-30, 11:53:16 AM] Jamie: Just my notifications? Or everyone?
[2020-11-30, 11:53:43 AM] Sien Tan: You must be a proud bf 😂. The tables have completely turned from 22 years ago...
[2020-11-30, 11:53:58 AM] Sien Tan: All of them
[2020-11-30, 11:55:42 AM] Jamie: And do not disturb is off?
[2020-11-30, 11:57:29 AM] Sien Tan: Yes and notifications are on. I’m thinking I might have to delete the app and re-download it but I’m worried that will just mess more stuff up And I will lose what’s in here.
[2020-11-30, 11:58:52 AM] Jamie: So you can backup all your messages first, then delete and redownload the app. I did it for Cathy when she got a new iPad and it transferred all her messages to the new device perfectly. This is what I would suggest
[2020-11-30, 12:00:20 PM] Jamie: Or under settings, notifications, there is a reset all notifications button
[2020-11-30, 12:01:20 PM] Sien Tan: Ok I’ll try both things and see. I’ve tried to back up my chat and for some reason the past couple of times that I tried it it wouldn’t work but will play with it again. Thought you might have an idea of an easier way. Maybe I’ll reset all notifications first 😊
[2020-11-30, 12:01:59 PM] Sien Tan: I’m going to log out of the app. Can you send me a message now that I’ve reset the notification settings to see if it worked?
[2020-11-30, 12:02:53 PM] Jamie: Test
[2020-11-30, 12:03:54 PM] Jamie: Test2
[2020-11-30, 12:04:24 PM] Sien Tan: Hmm nope. But when I’m in the app it works. Can you try test once more?
[2020-11-30, 12:04:34 PM] Jamie: Test3
[2020-11-30, 12:05:08 PM] Sien Tan: OK, so now I get a sound when I’m out of the app but it doesn’t pop up as a notification and all of my notifications are on
[2020-11-30, 12:05:57 PM] Jamie: I think it’s probably a glitch with the latest update.
[2020-11-30, 12:06:14 PM] Jamie: Losing wifi while I go for lunch 😘
[2020-11-30, 12:06:45 PM] Sien Tan: Ok should I delete the app and re install or wait for the next update?
[2020-11-30, 12:48:15 PM] Jamie: Were you able to back up your messages?
[2020-11-30, 12:52:00 PM] Sien Tan: I did. Your message notification comes up on my locked screen now so that’s good enough. I’ll wait and see what the next update brings. Enjoy your ensalada de frutes (sp?) 😉
[2020-11-30, 12:52:22 PM] Jamie: frutas*
[2020-11-30, 12:54:29 PM] Sien Tan: 😊 11 peeps signed up for yoga now including uncle Gary. My mum is going to join from the hospital so she can watch. Cute
[2020-11-30, 12:55:09 PM] Jamie: 11 people! That’s really great
[2020-11-30, 12:55:56 PM] Sien Tan: Yes! And I think Tom and Brenda will be doing it with Gary so maybe 13 which for online is really good 😌
[2020-11-30, 2:17:41 PM] Jamie: https://fb.watch/24-JBTvzzh/
[2020-11-30, 3:14:56 PM] Sien Tan: Some good reinforcement of things were already intending to do. I’m thankful you’re my tree 🌳🌲. Anything new for you? I found the part of neurosis and psychosis interesting... self doubt vs control 🌀
[2020-11-30, 3:15:44 PM] Sien Tan: I got a call from mum and they are planning surgery for this week. She’s bummed by it as thought she might not need it.
[2020-11-30, 3:18:01 PM] Jamie: He talked about that the moment the communication stop and we turn inward, it’s the start of a problem that can fester. This is coming up everywhere I look right now and I’m listening!
[2020-11-30, 3:19:47 PM] Jamie: That’s tough news but I trust that it will help with her discomfort. Any chance that they will learn something while they are in there about what is causing it?
[2020-11-30, 3:22:36 PM] Sien Tan: Yes, never ending opportunities to open...Can you say more about where you notice this coming up for you? 

I am trusting that whatever was mean to be will be. It’s. Bummer though as always hard to eco we from surgery. I’m going to clean her house today. It’s what I did last time she was in hospital and feels like a nice way to support her when I can’t see her in person.
[2020-11-30, 3:28:11 PM] Jamie: Recently starting with the book you gave me, the microscopic truth they talked about was about sharing even when you don’t have it figured out yet so your partner can follow your thinking. We felt it leading up to me going, the lack of honest chatting that had begun to dig out our foundation. And then again just in the last few days where instead of opening up about my discomfort in seeing you in pain, I held back. Which you felt immediately and sent your mind places. The festering.
[2020-11-30, 3:32:00 PM] Sien Tan: Ah yes, I can relate. Sometimes I don’t even notice I’m holding back it can be so subtle. Or I think others won’t notice it. With you it’s like you feel it before I’m aware of it sometimes. Good opportunity for me to learn in a safe space 🙏
[2020-11-30, 4:01:07 PM] Jamie: Bitcoin is going bonkers by the way
[2020-11-30, 4:04:22 PM] Sien Tan: That’s great news. Do you know if there is a way that I can calculate what the bitcoin that I have on my ledger is worth? Because I don’t have it stored online, I don’t know what it would be worth now unless I try and transfer it off of my ledger and back into the trading software that I was using.
[2020-11-30, 4:05:53 PM] Jamie: Without transferring you should be able to plug it in and look at your balance. The ledger will have software to look at it even if you don’t want to transfer.
[2020-11-30, 4:06:42 PM] Sien Tan: Ok, I’ll try that. Will it tell me today’s price based on market value? I thought it would just tell me what it was worth at the time I transferred it.
[2020-11-30, 4:09:05 PM] Jamie: They will often tell you but they pull the data from say coinbase. The price is 19480 usd right now. Do you know how much of a Bitcoin you have?
[2020-11-30, 4:13:20 PM] Jamie: Apparently there is an app that will read your balance from the ledger securely. Called ledger live. It’s on their website
‎[2020-11-30, 4:14:02 PM] Sien Tan: ‎image omitted
[2020-11-30, 4:14:13 PM] Sien Tan: I’ll check it out. Thanks 😊. I think I have this much bitcoin
[2020-11-30, 4:14:47 PM] Sien Tan: If that’s how much I have then I multiply by 19480 right?
[2020-11-30, 4:15:01 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2020-11-30, 4:18:34 PM] Jamie: Did you know how much it was when you bought it?
[2020-11-30, 4:18:40 PM] Sien Tan: Cool I’ve made a nice amount since I bought it then 😊
[2020-11-30, 4:19:11 PM] Sien Tan: It was 13685 when I bought it
[2020-11-30, 4:19:52 PM] Sien Tan: I just looked at my stocks I bought and they are up too  for the first time 🌀
[2020-11-30, 4:20:03 PM] Jamie: Geez and that’s USD too!
[2020-11-30, 4:20:19 PM] Sien Tan: Oh nice!
[2020-11-30, 4:36:50 PM] Sien Tan: Can I call you for advice with ledger?
[2020-11-30, 4:38:43 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2020-11-30, 5:11:03 PM] Sien Tan: Feels like my head is going to 🤯. It worked but you’re right, this is complex. Pretty much weeds out anyone not somewhat tech savvy.
[2020-11-30, 5:22:45 PM] Jamie: Hey great work!! Haha a little excitement for your day
[2020-11-30, 5:25:16 PM] Sien Tan: I’m playing around with it a little bit more and do you remember I told you I couldn’t see the amount from my ledger device screen? I don’t think my bitcoin was ever on the actual device, or me on the ledger program on my computer. I think I missed a step last time, LOL still trying to figure it out
[2020-11-30, 5:33:24 PM] Jamie: Oh boy.  Get that Bitcoin off the exchange ASAP. When the price gets high, some of the smaller exchanges will close their doors and run. It’s called an exit scam and with so many people signing up and buying Bitcoin, if they all leave their Bitcoin on the exchange, they can take the website offline and have millions of dollars worth of others people coins. And what could you do? There have been some huge exit scams, some as much as 50 million USD.
[2020-11-30, 5:35:17 PM] Sien Tan: I’m trying to get it off right now but the website says it keeps crashing
[2020-11-30, 5:36:07 PM] Jamie: Which website? Ledger?
[2020-11-30, 5:36:25 PM] Sien Tan: Coinsmart on the interweb
[2020-11-30, 5:36:34 PM] Sien Tan: Do you think it could have anything to do with the fact that my laptop is 1 million years old?
[2020-11-30, 5:39:18 PM] Jamie: I don’t think so. Maybe just a lot of people hearing the news of the prove and going to the site
[2020-11-30, 5:39:49 PM] Sien Tan: I hope so. When you updated the firmware on your wallet, did you have to re-download the bitcoin app? This is so confusing
[2020-11-30, 5:40:50 PM] Jamie: Nope. I go to the website of my hardware wallet, it connects to the device and I work through the website interface.
[2020-11-30, 5:44:31 PM] Jamie: CoinSmart has a good reputation and is registered with the Canadian government so it might just be congestion on the blockchain. What does the crash look like?
[2020-11-30, 5:55:14 PM] Sien Tan: OK, I contacted there the helpdesk and figured it out. I sent it to the wallet address that my Ledger gave me. It said that it takes 24 hours to process it from the coin smart website. Do you know if it just automatically goes to my wallet address then? I can’t remember what happened last time. I don’t think I’m built for this. Sorry to bug you again
[2020-11-30, 5:59:31 PM] Jamie: Ok great. Sounds like its on its way! Check tomorrow and it will be there. Somewhere a computer is confirming the transaction and sending it out every computer on the blockchain. It’s does take some time. 

That’s amazing that their help desk responded!
[2020-11-30, 6:01:06 PM] Jamie: And you’re not bugging me at all. I had to figure it all out on my own and it was  very stressful, specially the first time I sent some coins and it took longer than I thought, haha
[2020-11-30, 6:02:41 PM] Sien Tan: I can imagine that would be stressful. Do I need to keep my ledger device connected to my computer in order for it to receive the funds? And also do you know if it uses the same address every tile or does it generate new ones?
[2020-11-30, 6:08:07 PM] Sien Tan: Wow it worked just now. Like magic. It just appeared in my ledger account 🌈. Thanks my handsome sexy man. Such a turn on the you know so much I don’t 💦
[2020-11-30, 6:08:45 PM] Jamie: You do not need to keep it connected. The Bitcoin won’t ever be actually on the wallet, you are storing the keys to your Bitcoin (which resides on the blockchain). I think your receiving address can be different each time and it will go the same place.
[2020-11-30, 6:09:52 PM] Jamie: That’s always a relief!! Good lesson on Bitcoin today.  Now we know it’s safe and you got to experience a few things...
[2020-11-30, 6:11:26 PM] Jamie: https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works
[2020-11-30, 11:14:01 PM] Jamie: How was your yoga class?
[2020-11-30, 11:26:17 PM] Sien Tan: It was a no go. Only mum signed up, lol. I’m not surprised as there were never many online sign up for level 2 and only 2 last week. BTW happy full moon 🌕!
[2020-11-30, 11:26:27 PM] Sien Tan: Are you all packed and ready to move?
[2020-11-30, 11:26:57 PM] Jamie: I thought you had a bunch. Was that the earlier one?
[2020-11-30, 11:27:31 PM] Sien Tan: Yeah that was this mornings class
[2020-11-30, 11:29:24 PM] Jamie: Ahh, got it. 
And nope. I’ll pack at 11:30 tomorrow, it really doesn’t take long.

[2020-11-30, 11:30:50 PM] Sien Tan: He’s like a human in a cats body
[2020-11-30, 11:31:00 PM] Sien Tan: I love him 😍
[2020-11-30, 11:31:11 PM] Jamie: It was so creepy when he stared at the camera.
[2020-11-30, 11:31:23 PM] Sien Tan: I think you should take him home
[2020-11-30, 11:32:11 PM] Jamie: Haha he needs to get in line.
[2020-11-30, 11:32:44 PM] Jamie: Ok I’m fading off to sleep, 😘 enjoy the rest of your evening
[2020-11-30, 11:33:28 PM] Sien Tan: Sweet dreams handsome
[2020-12-01, 10:53:11 AM] Sien Tan: Happy moving day!
[2020-12-01, 11:22:44 AM] Jamie: Thanks beautiful. I’m all packed up and just counting down now. Great news about your mom maybe not having surgery
[2020-12-01, 11:25:03 AM] Jamie: One of my old friends in the electrical industry just reached out. I have been talking to him about maybe doing some of their lighting control remotely and he wanted to chat about it. Might just be work when I get back into Canada for a week or two on-site, then the rest remotely. Very exciting! It’s a 2 million dollar job so there is plenty of room for me.
[2020-12-01, 12:20:18 PM] Sien Tan: I can hear the excitement in your message to have opportunities. I love how things work out 💜. When do you move?
[2020-12-01, 12:25:04 PM] Jamie: I’m calling a taxi in 5 minutes to head over.
[2020-12-01, 1:25:39 PM] Jamie: Well I’m here but the wifi modem broke yesterday so we will see when that gets fixed, haha. And he took everything out. Blender, towels everything. I’m on the hunt!
[2020-12-01, 3:18:25 PM] Sien Tan: Happy hunting!
[2020-12-01, 6:41:35 PM] Jamie: It all worked out. I have a blender, towels, garbage cans, a freezer loaded full of smoothie supplies AND I surfed!
[2020-12-01, 8:01:29 PM] Sien Tan: Amazing! Must feel good to be home.
[2020-12-01, 8:16:34 PM] Jamie: It does. Tell me the best thing that happened today...
[2020-12-01, 9:19:13 PM] Sien Tan: I picked up my night guard from the lab and instead of $250 he charged me cash and it was only $150 🙌🏽. And it looks really sexy.
[2020-12-01, 9:47:48 PM] Jamie: Please record something sexy for me while you’re wearing it 😋
[2020-12-01, 10:19:31 PM] Sien Tan: I have to save something sexy for when you move back to Canada 🇨🇦
[2020-12-02, 10:17:26 AM] Jamie: A friend said to check out this guy. Maybe you already know of him...
https://g.co/kgs/WLHWKu
[2020-12-02, 11:17:33 AM] Sien Tan: Morning, I’ll check him out
[2020-12-02, 11:19:29 AM] Jamie: Morning. Wanna chat tonight? Doesn’t have to be long, interested to hear about your reaction to the mushrooms and Cayman Islands
[2020-12-02, 11:20:04 AM] Sien Tan: I’d love to
‎[2020-12-02, 11:20:28 AM] Sien Tan: ‎image omitted

[2020-12-02, 11:21:06 AM] Sien Tan: 🍆 or 🍄 ...or both?
[2020-12-02, 11:21:20 AM] Jamie: Ok is it best for you around 7pst?
[2020-12-02, 11:22:26 AM] Sien Tan: Yep that work or we can go earlier so it’s not so late for you. I don’t teach tonight.
[2020-12-02, 11:26:40 AM] Jamie: Ok let’s do 6PST. I’m off to the mercado to get some berries for my smoothie! 😍
[2020-12-02, 11:39:57 AM] Sien Tan: Oki doki
‎[2020-12-02, 12:24:31 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-12-02, 12:34:17 PM] Sien Tan: Mmm those look fresh and different from the ones we have here. Do they taste the same?
[2020-12-02, 12:36:14 PM] Jamie: A little between raspberry and blackberry. A very strong flovour that overpowers everything in the smoothie but luckily I like it. It’s a called mora which translates to blackberry or mulberry
[2020-12-02, 1:35:08 PM] Sien Tan: Good news, Roberta had breakfast this morning and all’s well so far :) PS-I started a Spotify playlist a while ago and am adding songs as they come up and remind me of you/us. I made it collaborative so you can add to. Musics such a big part of my life and I love sharing it so thought this would be fun to do together. My user name is sieninthesun and the playlist will be obvious ;)
[2020-12-02, 1:37:01 PM] Jamie: Is it slow down cowboy? 😉
[2020-12-02, 1:37:53 PM] Sien Tan: Lol no sir
[2020-12-02, 1:38:47 PM] Jamie: I found Sien Tan but not Sieninthesun
[2020-12-02, 1:38:54 PM] Jamie: And you have 134 playlists!!
[2020-12-02, 1:39:04 PM] Sien Tan: Haha yup that’s me
[2020-12-02, 1:40:12 PM] Jamie: Across the miles mix?
[2020-12-02, 1:41:12 PM] Sien Tan: No it’s thinking of you Feeny...latest one at the top. See it?

[2020-12-02, 1:43:14 PM] Sien Tan: How bout now?
[2020-12-02, 1:43:59 PM] Sien Tan: Weird it’s not the list I made when I open it. Except for the first song.
[2020-12-02, 1:44:10 PM] Jamie: There is two songs
[2020-12-02, 1:44:14 PM] Jamie: But I got it now
[2020-12-02, 1:45:12 PM] Sien Tan: We can keep adding over time. I removed the second song that wasn’t supposed to be on there and added one more 💃🏻 🎶
[2020-12-02, 1:45:47 PM] Jamie: Love it. I think of you often when I hear certain songs...

[2020-12-03, 9:30:00 PM] Sien Tan: Sure. When do you want to talk?
[2020-12-03, 9:30:17 PM] Jamie: I’m available now
[2020-12-03, 10:00:28 PM] Sien Tan: I’ll call you in 5?
[2020-12-04, 1:02:23 PM] Jamie: Hi there. I’m deep in the YouTube and found this one. I really like what she had to say...

[2020-12-04, 1:25:08 PM] Sien Tan: 10 peeps I. Class this morning
[2020-12-04, 1:25:17 PM] Sien Tan: Starting soon
[2020-12-04, 1:25:44 PM] Jamie: That’s wonderful. Enjoy!
[2020-12-04, 2:39:49 PM] Jamie: My mom is going on for hip surgery on the 18th! I love Canada 🇨🇦
[2020-12-04, 6:36:37 PM] Sien Tan: That’s great news!
[2020-12-04, 8:45:36 PM] Jamie: I just want to take the time tell how unusual and special I think you are.  You still surprise me in the most amazing ways.
[2020-12-05, 11:53:51 AM] Sien Tan: Morning, thanks for this!
[2020-12-05, 11:55:02 AM] Jamie: Good morning to you...
[2020-12-05, 12:08:06 PM] Jamie: How are you?
[2020-12-05, 12:13:16 PM] Sien Tan: I’m ok 🙂. How are you?
[2020-12-05, 12:15:46 PM] Jamie: I’m sluggish. I can feel the effects of the beer and I’m half annoyed at myself and half happy that I had some good conversation. The only two people there were Garth and Nino. Both interesting guys and it was fun.
[2020-12-05, 12:16:06 PM] Jamie: I’m disappointed that I couldn’t go for only a beer.
[2020-12-05, 12:40:46 PM] Sien Tan: I know that feeling
[2020-12-05, 2:36:05 PM] Jamie: I sent you a response to your email. 😘
[2020-12-05, 3:59:02 PM] Sien Tan: Ok, I’ll take a look when I’m home. Thanks
[2020-12-06, 11:50:24 AM] Sien Tan: Let me know when you have time to talk today
[2020-12-06, 12:05:34 PM] Jamie: Good morning. I’m just prepping for smoothies and making today’s. I’m available anytime after 10am PST
[2020-12-06, 1:14:35 PM] Jamie: Hi Sien. You’re right, I’m not going to be able to have a phone call right now. I am working on it, trying to understand my own anger. How can I hold space for your hurt when I feel like who I am as a person is being questioned? This is what I am searching for an answer for right now. And this is the line that I didn’t like —> “while you’ve said repeatedly that you’re not down there to meet girls, here we are”
[2020-12-06, 1:20:24 PM] Jamie: You are assigning me motives that just aren’t there.  And while I will admit to being careless with your feelings, I will not accept this judgement of me.
[2020-12-06, 1:21:23 PM] Sien Tan: A better way to say it would have been ‘you said repeatedly that you’re not down there to meet girls but you chose to hang out with Rachel so it’s hard for me to understand where your words and your choice line up.’ This is in regards to your question about how things seems to evolve around you. How is this a judgment? It’s what happened.

[2020-12-06, 10:16:26 PM] Jamie: Good night.  You taking a cat to bed with you?
[2020-12-06, 11:08:15 PM] Sien Tan: Good night handsome. No room for cats with Steve and all the pillows 😉
[2020-12-07, 11:23:40 AM] Sien Tan: Why does it seem so much less important to work out when there’s cats in the house?
‎[2020-12-07, 11:24:18 AM] Sien Tan: ‎video omitted
[2020-12-07, 11:26:06 AM] Jamie: Haha in a week, you’ll be trying to workout and they will be all over you
[2020-12-07, 7:17:34 PM] Jamie: Hey I feel like I’m behind on the new COVID restrictions. Just get the often inflated news... Are you still allowed to go to the animal sanctuary?
[2020-12-07, 7:56:26 PM] Sien Tan: Yes and I’m back in house teaching on Thursday 🙌🏽but unfortunately my family from the coast likely won’t be allowed to travel here at Christmas 😞
[2020-12-07, 7:58:07 PM] Jamie: Well...small blessings I guess that you can still see the animals.  Alberta seems to be in a real lockdown.
[2020-12-08, 1:33:17 PM] Jamie: Hi beautiful. Had a great chat with this guy Matt today about relationships. He is dating a woman here and is struggling. Listening to him once again made me realize the depth we have together. So thank you for being you!
[2020-12-08, 1:58:58 PM] Sien Tan: ♥️
[2020-12-08, 6:58:41 PM] Jamie: I would like to schedule a video chat in the next few days if you’re interested. I’ve been working on my tan and got my eyebrows done for you 😂
[2020-12-08, 7:12:35 PM] Sien Tan: In that case, yes! But when you say you got your brows done I hope you mean pierced like you’re living in the 90’s!
[2020-12-08, 7:12:54 PM] Sien Tan: Tomorrow AM or Thursday after I teach or...?
[2020-12-08, 7:16:45 PM] Jamie: I drone at 8am your time and should be back by 9:30PST
[2020-12-08, 7:21:49 PM] Sien Tan: Ok, let me know when you’re back and ready to chat
[2020-12-08, 11:11:57 PM] Jamie: Will do. Good night. Cuddle your cats for me
[2020-12-08, 11:24:02 PM] Sien Tan: Good night handsome 💤
[2020-12-09, 12:17:39 PM] Jamie: 👋 can we reschedule? They are cutting and grinding in the space below and it’s very noisy. ☹️
[2020-12-09, 12:18:20 PM] Jamie: I’m totally willing to try though
[2020-12-09, 12:13:27 PM] Sien Tan: Morning, I’m running a little bit behind this morning and I’m just hopping into the shower. Had a couple of unexpected things I needed to take care of. I’ll be ready anytime after 945. I know that you weren’t sure about timing so hopefully that time or later will work :-)
[2020-12-09, 12:22:23 PM] Jamie: They seem to have stopped grinding so let’s try for 10. That gives me time to make my smoothie
[2020-12-09, 12:31:45 PM] Sien Tan: Sounds good. Just out of shower. going to dress and will call 😊
[2020-12-09, 12:43:41 PM] Sien Tan: ‎Missed voice call

[2020-12-09, 7:26:00 PM] Jamie: It’s interesting to note that I am a little more aware of the signs of trauma in people lately. Not sure the exact connection to our work but it helps me to have compassion for them.
[2020-12-09, 9:06:38 PM] Sien Tan: Very cool. The wave looks small but I bet it feels bigger when you’re in it?
[2020-12-09, 9:08:55 PM] Sien Tan: Maybe easier to have compassion when we can see the cause for the behavior. The real challenge is to have compassion even when we can’t see the reason behind it. I’m working with the archetype agape right now through an online women’s group that I’m part of from the coast. It’s related to unconditional love and acceptance.
[2020-12-09, 9:17:35 PM] Jamie: Interesting. I struggle to have compassion for aggressive / abusive people but looking at them from the point of what they must have gone through helps.
[2020-12-09, 9:17:54 PM] Jamie: It’s not very big. But it’s was fun
[2020-12-10, 11:57:55 AM] Jamie: Morning. Here is the website for kinks but I simply cannot get it to generate my quiz. Maybe you can try?


https://mojoupgrade.com/
[2020-12-10, 12:05:47 PM] Sien Tan: Morning, I was just thinking of you. I’ll give it a go...
[2020-12-10, 1:16:32 PM] Sien Tan: Well I’m horny now 💦...I took the test but it wouldn’t save. Maybe they just do it to turn people on? Might be more fun as a conversation anyways. I think we’re at a place that we can talk about these things and don’t need the ice breaker? Would have been a fun game though 🙃
[2020-12-10, 1:18:33 PM] Jamie: Haha I love it. Thinking of all the things I will do to you?
[2020-12-10, 1:25:20 PM] Sien Tan: And the things I want to do for you ;)
[2020-12-10, 1:28:19 PM] Sien Tan: I’m trying a different one now. Carnal calibration...have you heard of it?
[2020-12-10, 1:28:44 PM] Jamie: Nope but I like it!
[2020-12-10, 1:29:03 PM] Sien Tan: It looks like we can comment too which is fun. You should get a link.
[2020-12-10, 3:22:10 PM] Jamie: Got the link. I’ll check it out
[2020-12-10, 6:04:07 PM] Jamie: Do you have any idea what kind of dirty things this website wants me to do with an onion? Hahaha
[2020-12-10, 6:16:47 PM] Sien Tan: You should have given me a sexier nickname, lol
[2020-12-11, 1:15:29 AM] Sien Tan: Good night! I hope you wake up with two healthy👂. Listened to this today and it hit a lot of good points. Xo https://youtu.be/cb6MFpGNjuE
[2020-12-11, 9:10:47 AM] Jamie: I feel great love and appreciation for you this morning. In fact, thinking of you in passing filled my chest and and I could feel emotion behind my eyes.
[2020-12-11, 11:12:24 AM] Sien Tan: ♥️
[2020-12-11, 11:49:57 AM] Jamie: I love that she takes so much responsibility for where she was and which behaviours of hers were contributing. And even acknowledging where then may have come from
[2020-12-11, 11:53:59 AM] Jamie: That was great!
[2020-12-11, 3:10:51 PM] Sien Tan: How are your ears today?
[2020-12-11, 3:20:56 PM] Jamie: There are ok. Not perfect but I think the alcohol / vinegar mixture helped clear it of water a little. I could hear it bubbling 😬
[2020-12-11, 3:21:12 PM] Jamie: I’m grumpy today, not sure why. How is your day?
[2020-12-11, 3:25:56 PM] Sien Tan: I hope it doesn’t clean away  all the dirty thoughts you have about me ;)
[2020-12-11, 3:27:31 PM] Sien Tan: I’m good today. Was supposed to walk with your sister but it’s snow/raining so we’ll reschedule. Hugs I miss you
[2020-12-11, 3:38:54 PM] Jamie: Will you chat with my for a few minutes? I would like to hear your voice
[2020-12-11, 3:48:09 PM] Sien Tan: Absolutely

[2020-12-11, 6:05:43 PM] Sien Tan: I’m not sure I feel about you touching another pussy but I’ll make an exception this time ;-)
[2020-12-11, 6:07:38 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah very similar. There was a whole litter of them abandoned in the park early last year and only 2 of 6 are left
[2020-12-11, 6:08:01 PM] Jamie: Don’t gender they
[2020-12-11, 9:07:34 PM] Jamie: I wish you were here. I’m interested to see how you would like it.
[2020-12-11, 10:54:04 PM] Sien Tan: I imagine what it would be like sometimes...
[2020-12-12, 11:12:02 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning, how are you today?
[2020-12-12, 11:32:22 AM] Jamie: Good morning beautiful. I’m going to try to see the doctor on Monday because my ears are not feeling good. But other than that I’m doing ok. The student marching band celebrated something at 5:30am this morning. For an hour, haha
[2020-12-12, 11:34:23 AM] Sien Tan: Sounds like you had vip for the band 😬. That’s shitty about your ears! Wish I could give you a big hug 🤗. Should have let me drip hot wax in them before you left ;)
[2020-12-12, 11:35:30 AM] Jamie: I’m hoping to get someone to do candleing on them, if the doctor proves difficult to contact.
[2020-12-12, 11:35:35 AM] Jamie: How are you this morning?
[2020-12-12, 11:38:37 AM] Sien Tan: Do you feel like your ears are getting worse or just dragging on? Tapping could help...I’m good. A little exhausted from last night. I almost fell asleep on the Hsu’s couch. Heading into the bush soon to tree hunt, hot chocolate and bon fire 🔥. Do you like that kind of thing?
[2020-12-12, 11:40:37 AM] Jamie: It’s hard to tell. Some moments they feel almost normal, other moments clogged and itchy in the left ear and just like there is water in the right ear. I can feel it resettle when I stand upright.
[2020-12-12, 11:41:58 AM] Jamie: How was it with the kids? I thought they were coming to your house?
[2020-12-12, 11:42:07 AM] Jamie: And I love hot chocolate and fire!!
[2020-12-12, 11:45:39 AM] Sien Tan: The girls came to my house to see the cats and then we went to their house for a friends dinner/get together prior to Christmas.
[2020-12-12, 11:46:27 AM] Jamie: Ah right. Was it nice to see some people? Did you have a struggle with alcohol there?
[2020-12-12, 12:03:32 PM] Sien Tan: I wouldn’t say I struggled with it but I definitely noticed that people were uncomfortable that I wasn’t really drinking. I nursed one Moscow mule all night, LOL. Actually Nicole also gave me a shot of tequila. Funny how attached to social norms and expectations it is. Definitely nice to see people and socialize although I got my period yesterday and was sooo tired so after my two drinks all I wanted to do was crawl in to bed. Miss and love you. Getting ready to head out 😘
[2020-12-12, 12:04:20 PM] Jamie: Love you too. Have fun ❤️
[2020-12-12, 6:01:39 PM] Jamie: If you want, tomorrow we can chat about Roxanne when we aren’t rushed. If more has come up.
[2020-12-12, 8:00:37 PM] Sien Tan: Nothing more has come up but I’d love to have a phone call. I’m going for brunch at 11. What time would work for you?
[2020-12-12, 8:14:29 PM] Jamie: Well sounds like you had a busy day. Why don’t you enjoy your deliciously slow start to your morning and text me when you get back from brunch?
[2020-12-12, 8:16:53 PM] Jamie: I remember when you originally said that you like a deliciously slow start to your day. It made me smile at the time and I will always remember it.
[2020-12-12, 8:31:29 PM] Sien Tan: It was a full day but felt soul good. Fresh air, nature, weenie roasting, hot chocolate and 🔥. Sounds good. I’ll text you when I’m home tomorrow, likely between 2-3. How was your day...any improvement on the ear front?
[2020-12-12, 8:33:29 PM] Jamie: That sounds wonderful! I’m happy that you got out into nature
[2020-12-12, 8:35:47 PM] Jamie: Ear is tough to judge, it’s seems to hover on the edge of pain and is still blocked. I think underneath is a fear of losing my hearing because I didn’t do enough. I’m done with it, hah. I did go for a run on the beach to keep my spirits up
[2020-12-12, 8:42:22 PM] Sien Tan: Ah nice, a beach run sound like the perfect way to transform the blues. I’m glad you’re planning to see a doc this week. I’m pretty sure it’s only really bad ear infections that can cause hearing damage if gone untreated. You’re doesn’t sound like it would lead to such thing. 

I was with some basket ball families that I haven’t seen in a long time. Jade, Cam and Sara were there too and some other basketball kids. Makes me appreciate how much I like to spend time with more like minded people where it’s not all about drinking and partying. Last night wasn’t about that either but there was still discomfort for others around my not drinking. When I said I didn’t want a shot Nicole put it in my hands and said, I’m not drinking alone. So much pressure to be somethinf she wants me to be. 

Found some people to snow shoe with and am happy to be broadening the friendships where others enjoy a wide variety of activities.
[2020-12-12, 8:45:37 PM] Jamie: Kind of an interesting byproduct of COVID.  Your time around other people is less so therefore more valuable.  Hard to “waste” it being uncomfortable.
[2020-12-12, 8:47:14 PM] Sien Tan: That’s so true 😊
[2020-12-12, 8:47:46 PM] Jamie: I want us to go snow shoeing too...
[2020-12-12, 8:49:50 PM] Sien Tan: Yes and sandshoeing...so many things to experience together ;)
‎[2020-12-12, 8:49:58 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-12-12, 8:52:46 PM] Sien Tan: That looks beautiful. Wish I was snuggling with you.
[2020-12-12, 10:07:53 PM] Sien Tan: When I think about you lately all I want is your hands on my body...everywhere
[2020-12-12, 10:16:04 PM] Jamie: It has been in my mind 😉.
[2020-12-13, 5:14:29 PM] Sien Tan: Hey good lookin’. I just got home and am going to put groceries away and have a brief chill. Ready to chat in half hour or more :)
[2020-12-13, 5:34:18 PM] Jamie: Ok, I just got back from my beach run. Gonna shower and then give ya a ring.
‎[2020-12-13, 5:55:02 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-12-13, 8:44:37 PM] Sien Tan: I meant to ask you your thoughts on if I should tell Roxanne that I don’t want to talk about Brad or wait til it comes up? It seems like she’s avoiding the subject with me right now anyways.
[2020-12-13, 9:10:42 PM] Jamie: Wait till it comes up. Sounds like she knows already and might just not talk about it. Are you able to let that sit between you?
[2020-12-13, 9:34:12 PM] Sien Tan: Yes! I prefer it that way. Not something I want to being up unless it needs to be...just wondering if she can feel something is up, but it’s not like she doesn’t know how I feel. Just wondering if it’s avoiding communication or if I’d be trying to teach her something. If she does want to talk about him it’ll be in the heat of a difficult moment for her and might add to the difficulty if I use that time to set boundaries. But maybe that shouldn’t be my concern?
[2020-12-13, 9:39:26 PM] Jamie: Can she even see your reluctance past her own struggle? I think you’ve done the best you can and the rest has to be up to her. I think it’s important to keep the boundary that allows you to not inherit her stress.
[2020-12-13, 9:43:59 PM] Sien Tan: You might be right, she might not notice what’s happening outside of her own issues much right now. Although she must be sensitive to how I feel about it or she wouldn’t have said she was having a hard time telling me they were back together. Maybe space is the best for both of us right now. Thank you for taking the time to tend this with me.
[2020-12-13, 9:45:04 PM] Jamie: My pleasure.  It would be a tough one for me too. I love you
[2020-12-13, 10:35:43 PM] Sien Tan: ❤️
[2020-12-13, 10:36:29 PM] Sien Tan: I just went for the most beautiful walk in the snow. It’s so quiet outside and the snow falling in the lamplight was pretty and I haven’t missed you that much in a while.
[2020-12-14, 12:20:27 PM] Jamie: Good morning. I can’t wait to go for walks with you again. Btw I had a wrap for lunch with lots of vegetables and I’m going to learn how to make pico de gallo so that I can get veggies there too
‎[2020-12-14, 3:37:01 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-12-14, 3:41:33 PM] Sien Tan: What are your thoughts on it?
[2020-12-14, 3:50:09 PM] Jamie: I don’t know. Perhaps a good sex life can come from communication and connection but communication and connection doesn’t always come from a good sex life. 

Or maybe this is why people have open relationships, because they have a life partnership that they want but have moved away from each other sexually.
[2020-12-14, 3:52:34 PM] Jamie: It seems like many of these dead bedroom situations comes after having children. I wonder if it is hard to get back the sexual attraction that might be forgotten during pregnancy and the first while of parent hood.
[2020-12-14, 3:55:12 PM] Sien Tan: Hmm interesting. I wonder if a sex life that develops with a foundation of good communication lasts longer than one without. Now that I say it I think so. I wonder if everyone is as mentally stimulated as we seem to be...Do you think life long monogamy is realistic for you?
[2020-12-14, 4:00:02 PM] Jamie: The problems I read about all seemed to be related to miscommunications. Either someone is hurt when rejected and then resents, or someone’s libido changes and they ignore the effect on the partner. In a safe space, these things ideally could be talked about and mostly avoided.
[2020-12-14, 4:01:12 PM] Jamie: The struggle is when one person isn’t horny and the other person is.  And if that lasts for months.  Is there an obligation to satisfy the other persons needs even though you aren’t into it?
[2020-12-14, 4:03:10 PM] Jamie: As for monogamy, I believe in the concept. But if the desire for the other person isn’t there, is the only choice no sex or cheating? I wonder if I could give up sex to stay in an otherwise wonderful relationship?
[2020-12-14, 4:04:15 PM] Jamie: This conversation has no ulterior motive, just so you know. 😉
[2020-12-14, 4:19:32 PM] Sien Tan: I find it interesting and hold no hidden agendas either. I think that when relationships fail it’s in more than one area and maybe you’re right, conversation and communication might be the bridge that keeps it together. We know that we shouldn’t try and get everything we need from our partner, but I wonder how/if that works I’m the area of intimacy and sex. I don’t think it’s fair to expect you to meet my needs 100% or all of the time, but then, does this open the door for someone else or is it back in my arena to take care of of it myself? Not something I’ve thought much about... we’ve both said we’re not looking to have sec with other people but I wonder if it’s something that we’d be open to over time if we felt unsatisfied...or is that just an indication that the relationship is ready to end?
[2020-12-14, 4:28:35 PM] Jamie: I think that’s a tough one to answer before it happens. Hard for me to picture a time I don’t want you
[2020-12-14, 4:31:32 PM] Jamie: I think both people would have to agree 100% to have an open relationship and I think that’s rarely the case. I feel like it’s usually one sided and the other person caves in
[2020-12-14, 4:38:01 PM] Sien Tan: Yes, I agreed to both the above thoughts and hard to imagine a relationship that’s going well in most areas but not in the physical arena. I can picture having different libidos but then, I think there are other ways to fulfill each other sexually that don’t have to include sex. This was a fun thing to experiment with before you left...I didn’t want to have sex but still wanted to engage with and fulfill you sexually. I know it was hard for you, but also enjoyable for both of us in a different way.
[2020-12-14, 4:38:41 PM] Sien Tan: We both answered yes to having sex with other couples...where do you see this fitting in?
[2020-12-14, 5:02:46 PM] Jamie: Actually the question was “ Have sex monogamously with other couples” which I read as 2 couples, in the same room, having sex with their partner.
[2020-12-14, 5:04:34 PM] Jamie: I see this as a great option. But is it obligation? Will it feel that way if one partner is not into it?
[2020-12-14, 5:11:41 PM] Sien Tan: I enjoyed pleasuring you but I guess it could also feel like obligation if the one giving isn’t really in to it. I’m thankful that our sex life is fulfilling and exciting but that we enjoy relationship and connection in other areas.
[2020-12-14, 5:12:13 PM] Sien Tan: Yes that’s what I meant, with other couples in the same room.
[2020-12-14, 5:14:00 PM] Sien Tan: I find the idea exciting as it’s the most ‘taboo’ I think I’d be comfortable going.  It I think it would require an attraction and comfort with the other people and might be something for a future exploration but not something I’d be ready for right now. Where do you see it fitting in. Could be saved for a phone convo too.
[2020-12-14, 5:18:51 PM] Jamie: Although I love talking about it, I think I would like to naturally explore the edges of our attraction for each other before including other people.
[2020-12-14, 7:48:26 PM] Jamie: I’m at a pizza place and you know what’s on my mind? I want you sitting here next to me.  And it’s not that I want you here, just that wherever I am I would enjoy your company.
[2020-12-14, 11:36:27 PM] Sien Tan: Sweet dreams, thinking of you
[2020-12-15, 9:01:14 AM] Jamie: Morning. Let’s talk about Portugal when you’re up. I’ll be back home by 8pst
[2020-12-15, 11:30:42 AM] Sien Tan: Morning, I’m just making a tea. Are you free to chat in 10?
[2020-12-15, 11:30:53 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2020-12-15, 1:50:06 PM] Jamie: In the future, please continue to call me out if I don’t answer you directly. Don’t always realize I do it but I could answer, then explain rather than going sideways.
[2020-12-15, 1:58:50 PM] Sien Tan: Ok, I will love. If feels like you’re trying to avoid an answer sometimes but maybe you’re processing? 🤷🏻‍♀️
[2020-12-15, 2:01:49 PM] Jamie: Maybe a bit of both? Specially with a yes / no question because it’s not always black and white.
[2020-12-15, 3:20:50 PM] Sien Tan: I’ve got a phone call set up with my cousin Stephen to ask for some insight from him. His wife, my cousin Sonora, is 17 years younger and he’s about toms age. I also message Tom and asked some q’s. Looking forward to our talk tomorrow and sharing more.
[2020-12-16, 11:55:20 AM] Jamie: Good morning 😘
[2020-12-16, 12:10:11 PM] Sien Tan: Good morning, I’ve had a dreaded feeling in my stomach since yesterday afternoon and didn’t get a good sleep. Are things ok with you?
[2020-12-16, 12:12:14 PM] Jamie: Absolutely. I’m eating my normal lunch right on schedule...

Since our phone call? Or did you talk to your cousin?
[2020-12-16, 12:12:45 PM] Jamie: I’m here if you want to chat on the phone, even for a few minutes
[2020-12-16, 3:38:40 PM] Jamie: Hey there. Just letting you know that I’m meeting Reachel tomorrow to take video of her surfing, so we can figure out why she keeps nose diving. Let me know if anything comes up...
[2020-12-16, 3:48:33 PM] Sien Tan: Thanks for letting me know. Definitely some stuff that needs to be talked about. Was going to bring up a link that I feel between this Tom thing and the Rachel situation. Not quite clear on what it is but there’s something here we could possibly explore together? Also, was going to ask more about why you hadn’t mentioned that she was attracted to you until yesterday but hasn’t felt like the right moment. We can chat later. I’m finding there are some dynamics of you being in Ecuador that I didn’t expect or understand until recently. You’re in a place where the culture and the norms are quite different and the dynamics of the world you live in are resulting in some discomfort for me which I don’t know how to address or navigate. Have been feeling it for a while but I’m also a little gun shy to share as I’m not sure how to do it without it ending up in the ways things have gone the last couple times... hopefully we can navigate together...
[2020-12-16, 4:28:30 PM] Jamie: Ok let’s talk about it tonight. ❤️
‎[2020-12-16, 6:08:44 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-12-16, 7:57:43 PM] Sien Tan: Yummy! I’m eating pasta tonight too. Just home and am going to shower and charge my phone for half hour. Chat soon.
[2020-12-16, 8:22:02 PM] Jamie: I will be ready in 5 or so minutes
[2020-12-17, 8:03:08 PM] Jamie: Hi there. I hope the cats didn’t pee anymore and I’m thinking about you
[2020-12-17, 8:03:22 PM] Sien Tan: Good evening :) I hope whatever sleep you got was refreshing. Let me know if you’re interested in another dinner together over the next week. I’d love to have a dinner together for the holidays.
[2020-12-17, 8:03:36 PM] Sien Tan: That’s funny we were texting at the same time
[2020-12-17, 8:04:09 PM] Jamie: Really? That’s a thing of beauty
[2020-12-17, 8:06:56 PM] Jamie: Totally in for dinner. Tomorrow I’m going try not to drink beer with Garth but he wants talk about home automation and that’s my jam. If your Saturday is open, we can do that.
[2020-12-17, 8:08:07 PM] Jamie: I think there is more to our conversation but I’m exhausted right now.  The birds had me up at 6!
[2020-12-17, 8:19:47 PM] Sien Tan: Yes, I’m tired too. Saturday works to finish leftover pieces from the conversation. Could we plan the dinner for another time as I’m hoping to just each other over dinner?  Not that we can have meaningful convo but might be nice to have some lightness too.
[2020-12-17, 8:29:45 PM] Sien Tan: *enjoy each other
[2020-12-17, 8:31:34 PM] Jamie: I think that’s a great idea.  Btw I surfed today! With earplugs
[2020-12-17, 10:00:22 PM] Sien Tan: That’s great that your ears are better :)
[2020-12-18, 3:40:07 PM] Jamie: I’m on that guys site digging through the podcasts and he has one about expectation that I am listening to.
[2020-12-18, 8:03:55 PM] Jamie: I’m thinking about us at the park near Knox, lying on a blanket, before we ever touched. I wanted so bad just to feel your skin.  I wish we were there right now, the sun was shining and I could smell you, tuck my face into the crook of your neck. Maybe a little weird, but honest.
[2020-12-18, 9:06:27 PM] Sien Tan: Haha I like your weirdness
[2020-12-18, 9:40:07 PM] Jamie: I did some research on military marriages because I figured deployment might be similar.  We do a lot of their suggestion but they also said that saying good night or good morning often help to Forster connection.  So... good night, Sien.
[2020-12-18, 9:40:27 PM] Jamie: foster*
[2020-12-19, 12:02:17 AM] Sien Tan: Good night handsome 💜
[2020-12-19, 11:30:39 AM] Jamie: Morning. What time would you like to have a phone call today?
[2020-12-19, 12:01:01 PM] Sien Tan: Morning, I’m hiking at 11. I’ll leave here at 1030 bit can chat while I get ready and eat or we can chat later. I’ll be home by 4 I think. What works better for you?
[2020-12-19, 12:07:05 PM] Jamie: Lets chat later. I’ll be eating at 4:30PST so anytime after 5:15 works. Enjoy your hike! Where are you going?
[2020-12-19, 12:08:16 PM] Sien Tan: Sounds good. I’m going to crystal falls or angel springs. Lol, I can’t remember the name and they both sound right.
[2020-12-19, 12:22:13 PM] Sien Tan: What’s your day like?
[2020-12-19, 12:24:59 PM] Jamie: I’m listening to more Jason Gaddis while I prep my smoothie. Some coding at the coffee shop in montanita later, surfing for sunset. Then I’m excited to talk to you about what I’m learning about us
[2020-12-19, 12:25:35 PM] Sien Tan: Sounds like a good day ☀️
[2020-12-19, 12:28:24 PM] Jamie: I think so. Last night was almost a sunset surf and it was beautiful.
[2020-12-19, 12:31:27 PM] Jamie: How’s the weather going to be for your hike?
[2020-12-19, 12:35:43 PM] Sien Tan: It’s beautiful.  Cold but sunny. Hope it’s in an open location so I can work on my tan ;)
[2020-12-19, 8:24:10 PM] Jamie: Hello. I’m home when you are ready
[2020-12-19, 8:27:59 PM] Sien Tan: Ok, I’m just finishing dinner. Do you want to hear me chew or should I call you after?
[2020-12-19, 8:28:18 PM] Jamie: You can call me after, lol

[2020-12-20, 11:48:27 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning 😍
[2020-12-20, 1:52:43 PM] Sien Tan: Interesting podcast. I want to share a glimmer I had...one of my triggers is not feeling heard/validated and I think it comes from sexual and emotional abuse. I feel shame around it and disheartened  as I’ve done so much work to clear it on my own, but it’s the first time I’ve explored it in relationship and it makes me feel a bit broken and afraid that you’ll reject me because of it. When I feel like I’m not understood, it brings up so much fear because it triggers a part of me that equates not being heard with not being safe. I’m going to continue healing this and I want to know if you can try to hold this wound tenderly and let me know in a compassionate way if you see it triggered before I do?
[2020-12-20, 1:57:12 PM] Jamie: I love you. This is a vulnerable sharing and I will treat it with respect. If anything, this makes me love you more instead of wanting to reject you.  If I see it, I will treat you with empathy and support you as much as I can.
[2020-12-20, 1:59:01 PM] Jamie: I would like to know the opposite side of this.  How can I make you feel heard / validated? Are there ways that trigger positively?
[2020-12-20, 2:25:53 PM] Sien Tan: I think you did an amazing job of this already when you accepted that I didn’t want to have actual sex before you left even though you didn’t like it and you felt unwanted and pushed away, you still held space for it. I don’t think either of us knew what was really happening at the time, but it’s a memory that I look back on with such gratitude and appreciation and it’s  helped form a safe base and bond to allow me to continue my healing journey.
[2020-12-20, 2:27:57 PM] Sien Tan: When you have a natural curiosity to understand more about me and my experiences and emotions it feels like there’s a safe space to see things differently and let’s me know that even though you might not understand me at that moment that I’m still safe ♥️
[2020-12-20, 9:21:47 PM] Jamie: My back muscles hurt today in a way that only comes from paddling.  I like it.
[2020-12-20, 9:57:19 PM] Sien Tan: Burn so good :)
[2020-12-21, 12:17:42 PM] Jamie: Good morning
[2020-12-21, 12:31:32 PM] Sien Tan: Good morning, how are you?
[2020-12-21, 12:34:15 PM] Jamie: I’m good. Slept so well that the birds didn’t even wake me.
[2020-12-21, 12:36:06 PM] Jamie: Had a super strange dream that I was coming back to Canada for Christmas and I was trying to organize all the details but I was already on an airplane. Then I had to quarantine but then I was trying to visit you and be back here for Christmas dinner? I could feel my confusion on how I would in 2 places for Christmas and quarantine for 2 weeks in each place.
[2020-12-21, 12:53:36 PM] Sien Tan: Lol dreams are strange. I had a dream that I had 3 cats that got into the cupboards and ate too much flour and I couldn’t get my phone to work to call the vets. I woke up so relieved that it wasn’t true.
[2020-12-21, 12:54:39 PM] Jamie: Ok that strange for sure. Weirdo
[2020-12-21, 12:55:37 PM] Sien Tan: Haha I did have a cat who would eat flour so somewhat based in reality 🙃
[2020-12-21, 1:02:01 PM] Jamie: Sounds like they are closing the beach here for the 24,25 and 31,1. Will be interesting to see if the military comes to enforce it. I don’t care about any of that but I really want to surf at midnight to catch the first wave of the year. It starts my new year off sober and physical and it would be my 4th year in a row.
[2020-12-21, 3:11:39 PM] Jamie: Did you apply for  this?

[2020-12-21, 3:52:22 PM] Sien Tan: Can you do a sneaky midnight surf? I haven’t applied. Thanks for the link :)
[2020-12-21, 7:18:30 PM] Jamie: I’ll do what the crowd does. If the surf guys go, I will.
[2020-12-22, 11:03:23 AM] Jamie: Morning! Hope the snow isn’t cramping your days...
[2020-12-22, 11:19:43 AM] Sien Tan: Morning :) there’s no such thing as too much snow. Make a great day!
[2020-12-22, 5:45:53 PM] Jamie: How is your day so far?
[2020-12-22, 7:44:27 PM] Sien Tan: It’s been busy but good. Yours?
[2020-12-22, 7:46:17 PM] Jamie: Great day. Surfed early in the sun. Had my place cleaned, perfected the algorithm to pull the transactions for my quarterly statements. Now I’m going some bbq.  Oh and I stretched this morning...
[2020-12-22, 7:47:00 PM] Jamie: I’m looking forward to seeing your sexy Christmas outfit for our call tomorrow.  😉

[2020-12-23, 11:10:17 AM] Sien Tan: Good morning, looking forward to dinner with you later 🍱
[2020-12-23, 11:31:03 AM] Jamie: Good morning, Sien. Looking forward to it as well. I miss talking to you
[2020-12-23, 7:49:51 PM] Jamie: How are you doing for timing? Should I wait till 8 o’clock before I cook my eggs?
[2020-12-23, 7:50:46 PM] Sien Tan: Sure, put eggs on at 8. I should be ready by 8 your time so call me when you’re done.

[2020-12-24, 4:42:57 PM] Jamie: So I made you a couple of Christmas presents. Do you want them tonight or tomorrow? 😜
[2020-12-24, 4:50:30 PM] Sien Tan: Oh my, now that I know...I can’t wait!
[2020-12-24, 4:57:25 PM] Jamie: Ok here is the first one...

[2020-12-24, 4:59:44 PM] Jamie: The second one I will send to you when I go to bed tonight.
[2020-12-24, 5:13:14 PM] Sien Tan: Wow, they are stunning! I hope to see them in real life one day with you :)That was such a thoughtful and romantic gesture ♥️. I don’t know if I can pick a favorite but the tiger eyes with the moon and the woman giving an offering to the ocean are amazing. I love that there’s so much creativity and artistic talent there. How special, I love you 😘
[2020-12-24, 5:17:37 PM] Jamie: I knew that you would like them.  I like the dog or the shaman. And I love you too.
[2020-12-24, 7:40:02 PM] Jamie: I’m cuddling with Carmello (the cat) at the Roadhouse waiting for my Turkey dinner. There’s live music but I’m tucked around the corner.  What are you doing right now?
[2020-12-24, 8:17:20 PM] Sien Tan: Sounds like a nice Christmas Eve 😊. I’m cooking a chicken

[2020-12-24, 8:20:39 PM] Jamie: So sophisticated, lol. Is it with your mom / John and Jade / Can tonight?
[2020-12-24, 8:20:50 PM] Jamie: Cam*
[2020-12-24, 8:28:42 PM] Sien Tan: Just Roberta and John tonight. Jade and cam and his family tomorrow night :)

[2020-12-26, 3:44:48 PM] Sien Tan: I haven’t planned anything with him. Will see how the year plays out.
[2020-12-26, 3:46:16 PM] Jamie: He was cool with that?
