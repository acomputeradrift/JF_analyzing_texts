[2015-09-24, 12:27:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Updated Whatsapp
[2015-10-11, 11:33:09 AM] Rob Feeny: So what are you up to for Thanksgiving m
[2015-10-11, 11:33:11 AM] Rob Feeny: *?
[2015-10-11, 11:34:37 AM] Jamie: Work. I am just doing my exercises, then breakfast, then 2 big proposals
[2015-10-11, 11:34:50 AM] Jamie: Allies was supposed to program but he bailed
[2015-10-11, 11:34:55 AM] Jamie: Allen*
[2015-10-11, 11:35:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok wasn't sure if you headed to Kelowna or anything
[2015-10-11, 11:35:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Your place close to programed? Or still lots of work?
[2015-10-11, 11:37:03 AM] Jamie: Yeah one more day. Just the camera and climate left
[2015-10-11, 11:37:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice. One more thing off your mind
[2015-10-11, 11:39:23 AM] Jamie: Yup. And Irene and I had it out the other day. I said what I wanted to
[2015-10-11, 11:39:39 AM] Jamie: So it is definitely over
[2015-10-11, 11:40:07 AM] Jamie: Which is a relief too
[2015-10-11, 11:40:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Good. She's been dragging you through this for too long.
[2015-10-11, 11:40:53 AM] Jamie: Yup. Wanna see what I wrote, haha?
[2015-10-11, 11:41:26 AM] Jamie: Irene I have to say this. Your method of ending our relationship was extremely painful and cowardly. Instead of having the courage to make a decision, you began to do hurtful things to create a wedge between us. Your behavior around Abed was extremely selfish and surprising, because I really did believe that you were a kind person that would do her best to not hurt me knowingly. And you knew it was hurting me and continued to do it anyway. But whatever attention you are getting from him, and Instagram and Facebook and the photographers is so important to you that you are willing to risk everything to get it. Your dental career, your relationship with your boyfriend, my respect and even any chance of staying friends when we broke up. The whole time telling me that you cared about me and wanted to stay together. This duplicity may have been an easier path for you but was the most hurtful way possible for me. I will struggle for a long time with understanding how someone could act so contrary to my understanding of who they are. I hope that you find what you are looking for and that no one ever does this to you.
[2015-10-11, 11:48:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Good
[2015-10-11, 11:48:41 AM] Rob Feeny: It's interesting to think that this may be the first time someone has ever actually just told her the brutal truth
[2015-10-11, 11:49:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Hopefully she accepts it and uses the information rather than just getting mad and defensive
[2015-10-11, 11:54:21 AM] Jamie: She got mad and defensive. But it rings so true
[2015-10-11, 11:55:09 AM] Jamie: At the end of our dialogue she even made reference to some of this behavior in her apology
[2015-10-11, 11:55:54 AM] Jamie: And that's when I knew that she knew a lot of this was bang on. Maybe not the motivation perfectly but definitely the behavior she exhibited and made me deal with
[2015-10-11, 11:56:20 AM] Jamie: But... I feel so much better that I said it
[2015-10-11, 11:56:30 AM] Jamie: And for me that's closure
[2015-10-11, 11:57:06 AM] Jamie: Because by trying to save the relationship I held back with my words. This time I didn't have to
[2015-10-11, 11:57:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Good
[2015-10-11, 11:57:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Let off the pressure and got it out of your head
[2015-10-11, 11:59:12 AM] Jamie: Yeah. It's interesting. I'm not that upset it is over because I kind of knew it was already and had braced myself. I'm ok that I'm not in this relationship with her anymore.
[2015-10-11, 12:00:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah it's been a while coming
[2015-10-11, 12:00:14 PM] Jamie: The anger I have to deal with is how it happened when I tried so hard to give her ways to end it peacefully. Lots of times I said we should just take some time off while we are not too angry
[2015-10-11, 12:00:58 PM] Jamie: But this way was best for her I guess. I will deal with it over the next few weeks and find a way to forgive her
[2015-10-11, 12:01:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah but it's hard to know what's going on in her head
[2015-10-11, 12:01:42 PM] Jamie: Really I think she avoided honking about it and just did what she wanted each day
[2015-10-11, 12:01:48 PM] Jamie: Thinking*
[2015-10-11, 12:02:27 PM] Jamie: And that told the story
[2015-10-11, 12:02:33 PM] Jamie: How's your head?
[2015-10-11, 12:08:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes that's exactly what people do and it's shitty but easy...
[2015-10-11, 12:08:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Still screwed up. I try not to think about it. But it hurts.
[2015-10-11, 12:08:45 PM] Rob Feeny: The fact that she isn't communicating with me at all, unless I contact her first, is painful.
[2015-10-11, 12:09:53 PM] Jamie: Maybe that's her easiest way. I'm sure she is struggling too
[2015-10-11, 12:11:16 PM] Jamie: I took me a bit to realize that Irene hasn't just moved on. She is having bad days and doubts too. Somehow that helped. My mind hand pictures her jumping gleeful into Abeds arms but I k or that isn't true
[2015-10-11, 12:16:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Exactly, that would help me
[2015-10-11, 12:16:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Knowing she hasn't moved on without a second though, that she isn't happy to be rid of me

[2015-10-11, 12:18:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanksgiving dinner in the slow cooker
[2015-10-11, 12:47:57 PM] Jamie: Looks pretty good
[2015-10-11, 12:48:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Pretty lazy day here. Need anything from the US?
‎[2015-10-11, 12:48:28 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2015-10-11, 12:48:39 PM] Jamie: Nope. But I've been looking at Hawaii for Christmas and it's not out rages
[2015-10-11, 12:48:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Finally replaced the one that got stolen years ago
[2015-10-11, 12:48:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh? Dean was asking what you were do for Christmas
[2015-10-11, 12:49:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I hear the flights are reasonable, but the accommodation is pricey
[2015-10-11, 12:49:56 PM] Jamie: I found some that were 600 to 1000 for 13 days
[2015-10-11, 12:50:18 PM] Jamie: Surf lessons are about 800 bucks
[2015-10-11, 12:50:28 PM] Jamie: Where are you going to be for New Year's Eve?
[2015-10-11, 12:50:53 PM] Jamie: I'm thinking about flying in to Kelona on the 31st
[2015-10-11, 12:51:13 PM] Rob Feeny: I have no clue now. Was going to be with Graz in Van
[2015-10-11, 12:57:44 PM] Jamie: I guess Cathy is having a 70th bday for dad? Figured I would spend New Years in kelowna but it would suck if I was there by myself
[2015-10-11, 12:58:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I think that was going to be in Vancouver. Cathy and Janice are working it?
[2015-10-11, 12:59:06 PM] Jamie: Oh right. Was it in Vancouver?
[2015-10-11, 12:59:16 PM] Jamie: That works out so much better
[2015-10-11, 12:59:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah Dean is talking about that. Still tentative but trying to keep it a secret
[2015-10-11, 12:59:52 PM] Jamie: Ok New Years in van. Anna will probably have a party but it's a snoozer, haha
[2015-10-11, 1:00:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha with her girlfriend?
[2015-10-11, 1:00:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah she wasn't much of a thrill at the last one
[2015-10-11, 1:00:27 PM] Jamie: Her and her friends just eat a disgusting amount of crappy food
[2015-10-11, 1:00:39 PM] Rob Feeny: And it shows?
[2015-10-11, 1:00:43 PM] Rob Feeny: And play video games...
[2015-12-18, 2:46:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Hope the flight is going well!
[2015-12-18, 10:17:11 PM] Jamie: Yup I'm at the house
[2015-12-18, 10:17:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome
[2015-12-18, 10:18:52 PM] Jamie: Kind of weird. Nice place but I got dropped of at the house and there is no one here.  I have a key and I am inside but I sort of thought people would be here
‎[2015-12-18, 10:19:21 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2015-12-18, 10:20:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe they're still in transit
[2015-12-18, 10:20:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Beauty, hot tub too
[2015-12-18, 10:20:47 PM] Jamie: Yes. Doesn't sound like anybody will be here until he comes to pick me up to surf tomorrow at 1 PM
[2015-12-18, 10:20:52 PM] Jamie: I'm going to sleep so good
[2015-12-18, 10:21:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Lucky bastard
‎[2015-12-19, 5:30:01 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2015-12-19, 5:30:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn man, it looks awesome!
[2015-12-19, 5:31:18 PM] Jamie: Yup. Lots of people paddle boarding on the river
[2015-12-19, 5:31:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice sceneo
[2015-12-19, 5:31:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Scenery
[2015-12-19, 5:32:13 PM] Jamie: Last night I ventured out in the rain to a local ocean side pub and sat at the bar, chatted with people for 3 hrs. Went for a run this morning and now I am heading or surfing
[2015-12-19, 5:32:19 PM] Jamie: Out*
[2015-12-19, 5:32:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn nice life
[2015-12-19, 9:37:24 PM] Jamie: Haha so windy out there today, I got my ass kicked. But my instructor broke his board so I don't feel too lame
[2015-12-19, 9:37:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh wow
[2015-12-19, 9:37:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Tired?
[2015-12-19, 9:38:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Heading snowshoeing with Faraz and some random people tomorrow
[2015-12-19, 9:38:55 PM] Jamie: Yes. I'm actually kind of embarrassed because I paddle back in before he was done with me because I had cramps in both of my legs and I was dying
[2015-12-19, 9:39:05 PM] Jamie: But I knew the first day would be hell
[2015-12-19, 9:39:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah
[2015-12-19, 9:39:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Plus you're old
[2015-12-19, 9:39:21 PM] Jamie: That's cool that you're finally get to go snowshoeing
[2015-12-19, 9:39:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes finally haha
[2015-12-20, 10:40:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Snowshoeing went well. Faraz and I joined another Meetup group that had 8 people going. 6 of them showed up and it was decent. Only made it 4km in, then turned around because we got a late start.
[2015-12-20, 10:41:02 PM] Jamie: That's awesome. Faraz is a great guy. 
[2015-12-20, 10:41:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah he was super chill. I think we were the two fittest people but man did we have fun, had a big snowball fight, slid down some hills on our butts
[2015-12-20, 10:42:33 PM] Jamie: Great man. Glad you got to finally go
[2015-12-20, 10:44:30 PM] Rob Feeny: How was surfing today?
[2015-12-20, 10:45:39 PM] Jamie: Much better. Still windy but I had more energy and caught some good waves. He is not a particularly good communicator but I am pretty fast learner. I woke up this morning and I could barely move I was so stiff
[2015-12-20, 10:46:10 PM] Rob Feeny: That's what you get for being an old man haha
[2015-12-20, 10:46:32 PM] Rob Feeny: But I'm glad you finally caught a few
[2015-12-20, 10:46:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Been eating well see you can fit in your suit?
[2015-12-20, 10:47:22 PM] Jamie: Totally. Running every morning too. 8km each day so far
[2015-12-20, 10:48:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice! Fatty.
[2015-12-23, 12:46:07 AM] Jamie: 7:45 and I am in bed. This place shuts down really early.
[2015-12-23, 12:46:30 AM] Rob Feeny: oh yeah I forgot that you are so much earlier than I.
[2015-12-23, 12:46:46 AM] Jamie: Couple hrs 
[2015-12-23, 12:46:49 AM] Rob Feeny: I guess that lets you focus on your Surfing
[2015-12-23, 12:47:21 AM] Jamie: Yes but tomorrow is the last day...
[2015-12-23, 12:47:25 AM] Jamie: Beach time!
[2015-12-23, 12:47:33 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm just driving back to Fairmont after a 15 hour work day
[2015-12-23, 12:47:56 AM] Jamie: Holy crap. Good day though?
[2015-12-23, 12:49:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Yes. Worked 12 yesterday. So that I can be free to volunteer to help build a tiny house tomorrow
[2015-12-23, 12:49:30 AM] Jamie: Cool.  What that for?
[2015-12-23, 12:49:35 AM] Rob Feeny: This was all the finishing for that network job I did with Sean
[2015-12-23, 12:49:56 AM] Rob Feeny: I just contacted a local tiny house builder who is having a workshop soon. I offered my services.
[2015-12-23, 12:50:30 AM] Rob Feeny: To help with all the prep for the trailer tomorrow and organizations.
[2015-12-23, 12:50:57 AM] Rob Feeny: Any cute girls there?
[2015-12-23, 12:51:19 AM] Jamie: Cool. Haha Jason is still sending me emails, he got another guy to consult that won't go to site
[2015-12-23, 12:51:36 AM] Jamie: Yes but they are all with boyfriends and family
[2015-12-23, 12:51:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Well that sucks.
[2015-12-23, 12:52:02 AM] Jamie: It's really tough picking up girls here actually
[2015-12-23, 12:52:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Not a backpacker vibe? More families?
[2015-12-23, 12:52:52 AM] Jamie: But the local girls all wear spectacular thong bikinis and they are beautiful Hawaiian / Japanese / American
[2015-12-23, 12:53:21 AM] Jamie: No backpacker vibes at all. Rich tourists and serious surfers
[2015-12-23, 12:53:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok that part doesn't sound too bad haha
[2015-12-23, 12:53:38 AM] Rob Feeny: Well how has the Surfing been in?
[2015-12-23, 12:53:57 AM] Jamie: At the best today these girls couldn't have been older than 17 but holy shit they were hot.
[2015-12-23, 12:54:04 AM] Jamie: Beach*
[2015-12-23, 12:54:14 AM] Jamie: Found a place to cliff jump too
[2015-12-23, 12:54:33 AM] Jamie: Surfing has been hard but awesome. Today was a great day for my surfing
[2015-12-23, 1:00:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Awesome. I'm super jealous!
[2015-12-23, 1:00:28 AM] Rob Feeny: And yah at lunch today there was one of those. With her dad. It was hard.
[2015-12-23, 1:25:16 AM] Rob Feeny: I went to white spot for a beer and it's all dudes
[2015-12-23, 1:25:43 AM] Jamie: Shitty deal.  It's a tough part of town
[2015-12-23, 1:27:55 AM] Rob Feeny: It's the Kensington one!
[2015-12-23, 1:28:12 AM] Jamie: For chicks, haha

[2015-12-24, 2:46:23 PM] Jamie: Haha awesome! Tell them I say aloha back!
[2015-12-24, 3:03:22 PM] Rob Feeny: So what's the plan for tomorrow?
[2015-12-24, 3:03:51 PM] Jamie: Surfing in the morning :)
[2015-12-24, 3:04:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice. Found a place for dinner yet?
[2015-12-24, 3:04:13 PM] Jamie: And then laundry and sitting in the hot tub and BBQ
[2015-12-24, 3:06:37 PM] Jamie: Yes my German fellow surfer and I are going to a dinner I found at a resort close by tonight.  $50 all you can eat and then going to the surfer bar at the resort for a 21+ pajama party and scary movie on the 10 foot screen
[2015-12-24, 3:08:07 PM] Jamie: You?
[2015-12-24, 3:08:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow sounds fun. Do you have pyjamas?
[2015-12-24, 3:08:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Just dinner with the family

[2015-12-24, 4:17:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Missed Cathy :S
[2015-12-24, 4:22:07 PM] Jamie: Seemed like curt man wants to get off the phone but I called back
[2015-12-24, 4:24:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Good, they were talking about it
[2015-12-24, 4:25:00 PM] Jamie: :(
[2015-12-24, 4:25:51 PM] Jamie: And this is why I leave town! Haha it's a mine field
[2015-12-24, 4:26:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Well you got everyone but her!
[2015-12-24, 4:27:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Anybody would feel left out by that
[2015-12-24, 4:33:15 PM] Jamie: It's sounded like guests had arrived and curt wanted off the phone. I took the hint and got off the phone. Had I realized the consequences, I surely would have insisted.
[2015-12-24, 4:33:57 PM] Jamie: I do appreciate you efforts to help me out
[2015-12-24, 4:34:22 PM] Rob Feeny: No worries man
[2015-12-24, 7:05:54 PM] Rob Feeny: So would you have the funds for a week in El Salvador in maybe March to surf and get my stuff with me?
[2015-12-24, 10:30:43 PM] Jamie: We can see. That's pretty soon. Depends on the flight.
[2015-12-24, 10:31:28 PM] Jamie: The jeep (The other surfers rental vehicle) got stolen from the beach with our wallets in it! Fuck
[2015-12-24, 10:31:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow yours too?
[2015-12-24, 10:32:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck better hope visa can get you a new card fast
[2015-12-24, 10:32:08 PM] Jamie: Yes. It was in my shorts under the seat while we swam
[2015-12-24, 10:32:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow. Rental?
[2015-12-24, 10:33:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Was there cash in your wallet?
[2015-12-24, 10:34:38 PM] Jamie: $100
[2015-12-24, 10:35:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch
[2015-12-24, 10:35:23 PM] Rob Feeny: 140...
[2015-12-24, 10:36:21 PM] Rob Feeny: So are you cleaned out?
[2015-12-24, 10:37:22 PM] Rob Feeny: At least you didn't lose your phone
[2015-12-24, 10:37:49 PM] Jamie: No I have all my other cash and passport back at the house. They stole our bags and only took the keys and the vehicle. My phone was in a hidden pocket in my bag
[2015-12-24, 10:37:59 PM] Jamie: We found the bags in the parking lot
[2015-12-24, 10:38:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh well not too bad for you. Was it a rental?
[2015-12-24, 10:38:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Welcome to Hawaii
[2015-12-24, 10:43:27 PM] Jamie: Yes his rental. Oh well
[2015-12-24, 10:43:48 PM] Rob Feeny: It could have been a lot worse
[2015-12-24, 10:46:13 PM] Jamie: Yes. Great got everything wallet cell phone sunglasses stolen
[2015-12-24, 10:47:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh your phone was stolen too?
[2015-12-24, 10:47:20 PM] Jamie: *Greg
[2015-12-24, 10:47:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Thought it was just wallet and replaceable cards

[2015-12-26, 8:33:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Whether I can do it for free

[2015-12-29, 11:33:25 PM] Rob Feeny: I totally understand. And it's not like you brought your laptop and can work / learn
[2015-12-29, 11:33:40 PM] Jamie: If I am not surfing everyday to get better, I'm just killing time between meals, haha
[2015-12-29, 11:33:55 PM] Jamie: Not complaining though. It's been great. Just time to come back home

[2016-05-10, 11:01:33 AM] Jamie: What do you mean by high maintenance?
[2016-05-10, 11:02:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Well I wish I had booked half my time in a hotel. He wants to have an elaborate dinner every night and drink until midnight.
[2016-05-10, 11:03:11 AM] Jamie: Sounds like it could be worse, lol
[2016-05-10, 11:03:15 AM] Rob Feeny: He seriously works like 2hrs a day. He eats and drinks 5x more than he works Haha. I get zero downtime.

[2016-05-10, 11:04:01 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm exhausted and my liver hurts. When I tried to decline dinner one night and he got pretty snippy. I just wanted to sleep.
[2016-05-10, 11:19:22 AM] Jamie: I sent you a link of the vertical garden plan I found. When you get back let's have some drinks (poor liver) and build it!
[2016-05-10, 11:34:28 AM] Rob Feeny: Sounds good man, Id enjoy that
[2016-05-10, 11:55:17 AM] Jamie: Did you check it out?
[2016-05-10, 11:55:34 AM] Jamie: I want to modify it. Double width and maybe some adjusted sizing
[2016-05-10, 12:16:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, just at lunch with someone
[2016-05-10, 12:41:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Doesn't look too difficult at all. What we're lacking is a table saw though.
[2016-05-10, 12:44:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok nevermind, saw the plans and we're fine.
[2016-05-10, 12:44:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Very doable.

[2016-05-15, 5:52:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck that was hard. Goodbyes are done. No more Graziella.
[2016-05-15, 5:53:08 PM] Jamie: I'm sure that was tough man
[2016-05-15, 5:53:15 PM] Jamie: Did you see her in person?
[2016-05-15, 5:53:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. She stopped by. 3 min max with her friend waiting in the car.
[2016-05-15, 5:54:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Said I'm sorry, thank you, I miss you, I love you, goodbye
[2016-05-15, 5:54:17 PM] Rob Feeny: More or less (I said, I mean)
[2016-05-15, 5:55:03 PM] Jamie: How do you eel about it?
[2016-05-15, 5:55:07 PM] Jamie: Feel*
[2016-05-15, 5:55:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Well she didn't say "I'll always love you" which I thought would be her cop out
[2016-05-15, 5:56:08 PM] Rob Feeny: She didn't say anything close. Just thank you and sorry I hurt you
[2016-05-15, 5:56:12 PM] Rob Feeny: That hurt
[2016-05-15, 5:57:13 PM] Jamie: I'm sorry it didn't work out the way you hoped
[2016-05-15, 6:05:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man
[2016-05-15, 6:05:19 PM] Rob Feeny: It's some closure at least. She looked me in the eye and said goodbye
[2016-05-16, 1:07:42 PM] Rob Feeny: So is an airport pickup doable or should I hit up Yannick?
[2016-05-16, 1:08:08 PM] Jamie: I will see you there at 7:40
[2016-05-16, 1:09:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome thank you Jamie
[2016-05-28, 8:19:17 PM] Jamie: I sent you a text at 4:56 today. Did you get it?
[2016-05-28, 8:29:57 PM] Rob Feeny: No
[2016-05-28, 8:29:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Damnit
[2016-05-28, 8:37:19 PM] Jamie: I was going to see if you were down for a beer somewhere tonight?
[2016-05-28, 8:38:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Honestly I'm busy working on that report now, after procrastinating too long. It'll take all night.
[2016-05-28, 8:38:23 PM] Jamie: Ok no worries
[2016-05-30, 11:39:21 AM] Rob Feeny: How you doing today?
[2016-05-30, 11:40:40 AM] Jamie: I'm pretty good. You?
[2016-05-30, 11:42:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Decent. Down in Abbotsford on a service call. Was just curious how you're doing, I know being cash poor is stressful
[2016-05-30, 11:44:03 AM] Jamie: Thanks for asking. Yeah I think I have to stop my monthly investments for some more cash. My personal credit card is growing not shrinking.
[2016-05-30, 11:44:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Ugh. Anything on the horizon to change that?
[2016-05-30, 11:46:20 AM] Jamie: Well physio isn't as expensive anymore and that was about $400 a month for the last 2 years. Now it's about $100
[2016-05-30, 11:46:46 AM] Jamie: But summer is expensive
[2016-05-30, 11:48:24 AM] Rob Feeny: I bet. Shit to buy, adventures to have
[2016-05-30, 11:48:32 AM] Rob Feeny: I need to get a real job
[2016-05-30, 11:52:43 AM] Jamie: Soon. Seems like you are finding ways to make money in that industry
[2016-05-30, 12:00:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Slowly. Haha
[2016-05-30, 5:59:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Just found $200 US that I stashed in my satchel when I was in El Salvador. Feels like Christmas

[2016-06-07, 6:00:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Pretty damn cool
[2016-06-07, 6:05:13 PM] Jamie: Those are cool!
[2016-06-07, 6:09:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I love the style. Goes with the chairs

[2016-06-28, 12:21:16 AM] Jamie: Savage!
[2016-06-28, 11:33:59 PM] Jamie: Check this out:Tentsile T-Mini 2 Person Hammock https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G9PHQSI/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_n_awd_d_O-0Cxb4X8S6KD
[2016-06-28, 11:34:11 PM] Jamie: This would be sweet
[2016-06-28, 11:43:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Very neat. Now I want to build a city in the trees...

[2016-06-29, 7:41:42 PM] Jamie: Really cool
[2016-06-29, 7:43:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. I'm so sunburned. Learned a lot.
[2016-06-29, 7:46:19 PM] Rob Feeny: It was actually pretty cool, because I had no help and I was in charge haha
[2016-06-29, 7:46:42 PM] Rob Feeny: It forced me to learn because I had another guy looking to me for instruction
[2016-06-30, 10:52:17 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm a dumbass. I forgot to flip my bike back off of the reserve tank last time I filled it up and just ran out of gas
[2016-06-30, 10:52:34 PM] Rob Feeny: So I had to buy a $12 gas can for $3 worth of gas
[2016-06-30, 10:53:00 PM] Jamie: Well that's only $15 dollars for that lesson. Haha
[2016-06-30, 10:53:29 PM] Jamie: Wow Long day
[2016-06-30, 10:55:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Well we had that tiny house meet up afterwards. I'm just on my way to buy a motorcycle cover and then to Mike's
[2016-06-30, 10:55:26 PM] Rob Feeny: The days at Westcoast don't feel very long because it's really enjoyable to be there
[2016-06-30, 10:55:38 PM] Rob Feeny: They actually offered me a full-time job but I don't want to work there full time
[2016-06-30, 10:55:54 PM] Jamie: That's cool. I tried to make it by but the day filled up
[2016-06-30, 10:55:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Although in two weeks I'm going to fly with them to set her not Island and install a 3 piece home the same one we put the solar panels on
[2016-06-30, 10:56:13 PM] Rob Feeny: No worries man I understand
[2016-06-30, 10:56:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Saturna
[2016-06-30, 10:56:45 PM] Jamie: That's cool. This install skill is very valuable to my company too. I can pay you good money for solar jobs
[2016-06-30, 10:57:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I was really happy to get some hands-on experience
[2016-06-30, 10:57:16 PM] Jamie: I'm jealous.
[2016-06-30, 10:57:26 PM] Rob Feeny: That guy Craig that I sent to them is working for them as well and he helped me with the install. He has a technical diploma in all of that
[2016-06-30, 10:57:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Might be a good labor are for for a solar job in the future
[2016-06-30, 10:57:58 PM] Jamie: Awesome. Employee or contractor?
[2016-06-30, 10:58:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Honestly I thought the racking system was terrible and have already redesigned it in my head
[2016-06-30, 10:58:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Contractor. He really wants to do solar but he lives out in Maple Ridge and he's 50
[2016-06-30, 10:58:18 PM] Jamie: Can you compare it against what we are installing?
[2016-06-30, 10:58:46 PM] Rob Feeny: He actually said he wouldn't come and work the motor mah job for free for the experience
[2016-06-30, 10:58:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Would
[2016-06-30, 10:59:08 PM] Rob Feeny: This system installed it at 40 degrees and is less technical. I think the system we are using is better
[2016-06-30, 10:59:13 PM] Jamie: Nice. Is the racking we're going to install better than the stuff you just installed?
[2016-06-30, 10:59:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes.
[2016-06-30, 10:59:50 PM] Rob Feeny: It's less complicated
[2016-06-30, 10:59:53 PM] Jamie: Ok good. Did you see the email from Rob about changing the spacing?
[2016-06-30, 11:00:21 PM] Rob Feeny: This rocking involved five different sizes of Bolt heads plus two screw Styles and an allen key
[2016-06-30, 11:00:47 PM] Rob Feeny: I a fuck I saw that when I was on the roof and meant to go back to it. I will check it out when I get home
[2016-06-30, 11:01:09 PM] Rob Feeny: This tracking is attached only to the roofing material and not screwed into the structure of the roof
[2016-06-30, 11:01:24 PM] Rob Feeny: I wouldn't trust it in a big storm. I think it would rip the roofing off
[2016-06-30, 11:02:20 PM] Jamie: No worries. We can look at it Monday.
[2016-06-30, 11:04:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok bike is running, talk soon
‎[2016-07-01, 7:44:38 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎video omitted
[2016-07-01, 10:34:08 AM] Jamie: Haha
[2016-07-01, 10:34:36 AM] Rob Feeny: I was expecting  a 'fucker' or something in reply...
[2016-07-01, 5:13:25 PM] Rob Feeny: So how was it?
[2016-07-01, 5:13:44 PM] Jamie: Painful
[2016-07-01, 5:14:20 PM] Jamie: Like actually. Calves and hips just not used to 18kms plus the grind
[2016-07-01, 5:14:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet. How long did it take?
[2016-07-01, 5:17:12 PM] Jamie: 3.5hrs?
[2016-07-01, 5:18:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. Plans this evening? Recovery?
[2016-07-01, 5:18:59 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah. Nothing I think. How was your night?
[2016-07-01, 5:19:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Night was fun, hectic and not enough sleep. Morning hike was exhausting. We were behind and basically ran the the last few km to be there before sunrise
[2016-07-01, 5:19:55 PM] Jamie: How many people?
[2016-07-01, 5:20:34 PM] Rob Feeny: We had 12
[2016-07-01, 5:20:44 PM] Rob Feeny: And champagne haha
[2016-07-01, 5:20:45 PM] Jamie: Oh wow
[2016-07-01, 5:21:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Now I'm contemplating sushi and more sleep Haha
[2016-07-02, 12:02:09 PM] Rob Feeny: What are you up to today?
[2016-07-02, 12:02:52 PM] Jamie: Did you get my text response?
[2016-07-02, 12:03:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope. That's why I tried Whatsapp
[2016-07-02, 12:03:33 PM] Jamie: Not doing much. Gonna read and have a coffee and that's as far as I've planned
‎[2016-07-02, 12:03:59 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2016-07-02, 12:04:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha decent. I waited here until 10 and now I give up. I'll stop by Starbucks on my way home
[2016-07-02, 12:04:17 PM] Jamie: Cool see ya then
[2016-07-02, 12:04:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Grrrrr
[2016-07-02, 12:04:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Westcoast Outbuildings
[2016-07-02, 12:16:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok scratch that, the guy just called me. 11am start lol
[2016-07-02, 12:16:35 PM] Jamie: Well it's work
[2016-07-02, 12:16:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep
[2016-07-02, 12:17:09 PM] Jamie: Dinner or beers or something tonight if you don't work too late
[2016-07-02, 12:38:24 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm in. Nikos and Company are in town as well so I have just got to coordinate with them
[2016-07-02, 12:55:31 PM] Jamie: Cool. Remember I turn into a pumpkin as it gets close to 10pm, lol
[2016-07-02, 12:58:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha of course
[2016-07-02, 8:25:05 PM] Rob Feeny: I just finished working. Sorry man going to shower and head to your place
[2016-07-02, 8:25:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Want me to pick up something to barbecue?
[2016-07-02, 8:26:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Or maybe I'll just come directly there
[2016-07-02, 8:26:50 PM] Rob Feeny: If you can handle me dirty as all hell hahs
[2016-07-02, 8:27:18 PM] Jamie: Whatever works best for you. I am going to do a short workout so you have time to shower
[2016-07-02, 8:27:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool
[2016-07-02, 8:27:38 PM] Jamie: I have salmon and sweet potato but no veggies
[2016-07-02, 8:27:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay I'll bring some
[2016-07-02, 8:28:07 PM] Jamie: And no beer
[2016-07-02, 8:28:35 PM] Rob Feeny: I have rum and coke if you're interested.
[2016-07-02, 8:28:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Or I can pick up some beer
[2016-07-02, 8:30:08 PM] Jamie: If you want to grab a 12 pac okanagan springs pale ale cans I have cash here
[2016-07-02, 9:17:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Beer acquired. on my way. It's raining over here
[2016-07-02, 9:17:39 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-07-03, 12:39:36 AM] Rob Feeny: You're a chump
[2016-07-04, 10:00:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey I'm fairly certain that 1949 West 36th uses 16" Joists, but do you have a spec drawing anywhere that confirms it?
[2016-07-04, 10:01:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Also, have you been on site recently? Do you know if the curbs have been installed? Otherwise I'll call Kris
[2016-07-04, 10:01:22 AM] Rob Feeny: That's all Rob wanted to know
[2016-07-04, 10:50:31 AM] Jamie: I don't think they have been installed. If you could call Kris that would be great
[2016-07-04, 10:50:42 AM] Rob Feeny: On it
[2016-07-05, 11:20:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Did you get the drawings yesterday?
[2016-07-05, 11:36:48 AM] Jamie: Nope too busy. Maybe today
[2016-07-05, 11:38:58 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-07-05, 7:15:55 PM] Jamie: Fuck. Shayne just fell asleep at the wheel of my van. Crashed into the Meridian on the highway
[2016-07-05, 7:16:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap. Is he ok?
[2016-07-05, 7:16:26 PM] Jamie: Yes. He's fine not hurt at all
[2016-07-05, 7:16:58 PM] Rob Feeny: The van?
[2016-07-05, 7:17:13 PM] Jamie: Not drivable. He's going to take some pictures and send it to me
[2016-07-05, 7:17:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Crap man
[2016-07-05, 7:17:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch.
[2016-07-05, 7:17:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Will insurance provide a rental?
[2016-07-05, 7:18:14 PM] Jamie: I think so
[2016-07-05, 7:18:37 PM] Rob Feeny: He been working nights?
[2016-07-05, 7:19:14 PM] Jamie: I didn't ask.
[2016-07-05, 7:20:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Not normal to fall asleep at the wheel, just wonder why
[2016-07-05, 7:22:41 PM] Jamie: I think you pegged it
[2016-07-05, 7:25:44 PM] Rob Feeny: I wouldn't see it as partying on the Tuesday after  a long weekend. Unless he was away partying all weekend.
[2016-07-06, 12:05:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey what day were we talking about having the party?
[2016-07-06, 9:45:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Just added you to a conversation for a backpacking trip Aug 6-7 someone in my hiking group is organizing
[2016-07-06, 9:45:37 AM] Jamie: I wondered where that came from, lol
[2016-07-06, 9:46:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha
[2016-07-06, 9:46:31 AM] Rob Feeny: It's a Meetup. For the Howe Sound Crest trail
[2016-07-06, 9:46:53 AM] Jamie: 15km a day. Yowza.
[2016-07-06, 9:55:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha bug baby
[2016-07-06, 9:55:22 AM] Rob Feeny: *big baby
[2016-07-06, 9:55:46 AM] Jamie: Sounds good. I'm in
[2016-07-06, 9:55:58 AM] Rob Feeny: Beauty. Want to join the Meetup?
[2016-07-06, 9:58:56 AM] Jamie: Done
[2016-07-06, 9:59:05 AM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2016-07-06, 12:20:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you get a chance to grab the drawings?
[2016-07-06, 12:47:06 PM] Jamie: Nope.
[2016-07-06, 12:47:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok maybe I can coordinate sending them by Courier to Jammy?
[2016-07-06, 12:52:26 PM] Jamie: That would be great
[2016-07-06, 12:57:57 PM] Rob Feeny: On it
[2016-07-06, 1:05:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Fucking hell I'm really starting to hate Rob Baxter
[2016-07-06, 1:06:09 PM] Jamie: Yeah he is a minimum amount possible kinda guy
[2016-07-06, 1:06:18 PM] Jamie: I will never work with him again
[2016-07-06, 1:16:15 PM] Jamie: What hostel did you stay in in San Juan del sur?
[2016-07-06, 1:19:20 PM] Rob Feeny: We didn't stay at the hospital. We stayed at a casa de huéspedes right next to pachamama
[2016-07-06, 1:19:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Just a small rooming house run by a family in their home with 3 rooms. I would have to try to find it on a map to get the name.
[2016-07-06, 1:19:54 PM] Jamie: Ok I can find it. No problem
[2016-07-06, 1:20:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I replied to Rob Baxter and tried to stay civil
[2016-07-06, 1:20:51 PM] Jamie: I read it. Very frustrating dealing with that guy
[2016-07-06, 1:35:25 PM] Jamie: Let's just get what he has over to Jammy and see what she says
[2016-07-08, 5:35:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Just FYI, docs are with the Architect, Jammy is out of town but someone else is dealing with it until next week
[2016-07-08, 5:35:23 PM] Rob Feeny: And what should we do about the party? Did we get scooped by all the other ones?
[2016-07-08, 5:36:04 PM] Jamie: Yeah I don't think we can do it same day. Maybe the Friday?
[2016-07-08, 5:47:38 PM] Rob Feeny: 22nd? I have my BCSEA thank you BBQ
[2016-07-09, 4:54:20 PM] Jamie: What weekend is the cabin weekend? End of this month right?
[2016-07-09, 4:54:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2016-07-09, 4:54:52 PM] Rob Feeny: 30, 31, 1
[2016-07-11, 11:45:10 AM] Jamie: Call me when you can
[2016-07-11, 11:57:15 AM] Rob Feeny: I think we should forward that email to Rob and just say "As we stated, the drawings we promised the Architect are required. The example you sent originally from Schletter was acceptable, the schedule B was not."
[2016-07-11, 11:58:44 AM] Jamie: Yes I was thinking the same thing. Careful though, some of my comments are in the train about VREC
[2016-07-11, 11:59:00 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll cut and paste
[2016-07-11, 12:12:56 PM] Rob Feeny: I should have gone right to Schletter and cut Rob out of the circuit
[2016-07-11, 12:31:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Just got a call from Jammy Arthur, I explained some of the situation and that we're waiting to hear back from Rob Baxter and apologized for the hassle
[2016-07-11, 12:31:28 PM] Jamie: Ok great
[2016-07-12, 12:11:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Rob says "a day or two" on the revised drawings. Spoke with Jammy Arthur on the phone and updated him as well.
[2016-07-12, 12:19:40 PM] Jamie: Ok great. Bit by bit
[2016-07-12, 6:55:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Any interest in getting the Feeny power name on the BCSEA solar power station? We're looking for sponsors.
[2016-07-12, 6:56:08 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm going to send you my calculations sheet in a bit if you have a chance to look it over...
[2016-07-12, 6:56:28 PM] Rob Feeny: When I'm don'e organizing this, I'll do Jay's display sheet
[2016-07-12, 6:56:30 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2016-07-12, 6:58:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Want me to fire your into to our fundraising girl? She's kinda cute haha
[2016-07-12, 6:58:27 PM] Jamie: Sure lol
[2016-07-13, 10:59:31 AM] Jamie: Ever heard of Googles project sunroof? Not in Canada yet but pretty cool idea
[2016-07-13, 12:18:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes I checked it out a while ago but need to look at it more
[2016-07-13, 3:04:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Electric
‎[2016-07-13, 3:04:16 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-07-13, 3:12:44 PM] Jamie: Love it
[2016-07-14, 3:32:11 PM] Jamie: Did Rob Baxter just ask that?
[2016-07-14, 3:36:57 PM] Rob Feeny: I can't believe this guy
[2016-07-14, 3:38:33 PM] Rob Feeny: The level of his incompetence actually blows my mind
[2016-07-14, 3:38:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe he's the type of hippie that did way too many drugs back in the sixties
[2016-07-14, 5:54:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Avoid Hastings in the Heights
[2016-07-14, 5:54:23 PM] Rob Feeny: They're setting up for the bike race and shutting down the roads
[2016-07-14, 5:54:48 PM] Jamie: Yeah I'm sitting at cafe Artigiano. I think I'm screwed, lol
[2016-07-14, 6:02:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha just enjoy the view
[2016-07-15, 10:42:44 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm sure you're crazy busy today but I am working on a split AC DC system in a tiny house today but I thought you would find interesting. And I could use help haha
[2016-07-15, 1:12:29 PM] Jamie: Yeah sorry man, have to get these proposals out
[2016-07-15, 1:20:23 PM] Rob Feeny: No problem
[2016-07-15, 6:47:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey man just FYI I called Rob Baxter twice today about the drawings but he hasn't picked up I left him a voicemail
[2016-07-15, 6:47:40 PM] Jamie: Want me to call him?
[2016-07-15, 6:47:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure maybe he will pick up your calls
[2016-07-17, 8:34:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Well Dan's trying to get everyone to eat and the Pangs aren't even here yet. People are just arriving
[2016-07-17, 8:35:34 PM] Jamie: Crazy. I'm 10 minutes from my house but probably 30 minutes to dance
[2016-07-17, 8:38:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok we'll save you some. Dan's having a fit
[2016-07-17, 8:39:23 PM] Jamie: Yeah he gets freaked out when he's responsible for the cooking
[2016-07-18, 1:34:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a second for a call?
[2016-07-18, 1:38:33 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-07-19, 1:18:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Rob Baxter says the guy who needs to stamp the drawings is not back from vacation for 2 weeks
[2016-07-19, 1:19:53 PM] Rob Feeny: So I talked to Jammy to see if the drawings could work in conjunction with the Schedule B but he says they need those stamped drawings.
[2016-07-19, 1:20:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Couldn't get Rob on the phone, hence the email
[2016-07-19, 1:20:36 PM] Jamie: Can't we take what we have to Earl (city guy)  and see what he says?
[2016-07-19, 1:21:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Just got the reply from Rob. Schletter will have the drawing stamped tomorrow. I'll ask about the BC engineer stamp
[2016-07-19, 1:22:22 PM] Jamie: Ok. Sounds good.
[2016-07-19, 5:56:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok so Rob doesn't know his head from his ass re: stamps in BC /Ontario so as soon as he has the drawings tomorrow he'll call me, I'll stay on it all day until we the  architect / engineer are happy. I'll just go around him if needed once I have drawings
[2016-07-19, 6:09:59 PM] Jamie: Perfect.
[2016-07-20, 9:05:35 AM] Rob Feeny: What's your Saturday / Sunday looking like? I'd love to get out hiking. Found a post about swimable waterfalls in the Vancouver area...
[2016-07-20, 9:06:22 AM] Jamie: Saturday is the park warming from 1-5 at New Brighton park. Friends house warming at a park near her house
[2016-07-20, 9:06:28 AM] Jamie: Sunday is open
[2016-07-20, 9:06:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Sunday evening we have Am's birthday
[2016-07-20, 9:07:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha the Sunday dinners are never ending
[2016-07-20, 9:07:46 AM] Rob Feeny: http://vivalifestyleandtravel.com/vancouver/arts-and-culture/list/waterfalls-swim-vancouver#.V44nxDllDqA
[2016-07-20, 9:24:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow they're still no fire ban at the cabin yet. I hope it holds until the long weekend.
[2016-07-20, 9:33:47 AM] Jamie: That would be sweet
[2016-07-20, 9:38:22 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm going to set up an event on Meetup for it
[2016-07-20, 9:43:01 AM] Rob Feeny: There are 3 good options, the one near whistler, the one in Golden ears or the one in Mission. I'll research them
[2016-07-20, 11:05:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Got time for electrical question?
[2016-07-20, 11:16:58 AM] Jamie: 5 min
‎[2016-07-20, 11:19:03 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-07-20, 11:19:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool
[2016-07-20, 12:19:46 PM] Jamie: $17500 damage to the van. Pretty sure they are going to write it off
[2016-07-20, 12:19:53 PM] Jamie: FUUUUUUUUUUCK
[2016-07-20, 12:20:15 PM] Jamie: Not only do I lose a van but now I got an outfit a new one purchase a new one and find probably a new employee
[2016-07-20, 12:20:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap man. He really fucked it up.
[2016-07-20, 12:20:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Can't you at least switch all the racking and other things into the new van? Or will it not be the same van?
[2016-07-20, 12:22:05 PM] Jamie: Yes I can. I don't know if it'll be the same van. I have $1000 still to pay on that one
[2016-07-20, 12:27:14 PM] Jamie: I'm not 100% sure I can handle all the bad that comes with the good. Whenever we get busy and I seem to make some money shit falls apart
[2016-07-20, 12:34:51 PM] Rob Feeny: I totally understand man and you even have your shit more together than me. At times I wonder how you do it.
[2016-07-20, 12:48:15 PM] Jamie: Me too. Shayne just became a much less valuable employee. His estimated rate to drive the vehicle goes from $250-$350 a month. And we have to source and outfit a new van.
[2016-07-20, 12:49:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. But he'd cost you probably 10k to replace in training
[2016-07-20, 12:49:43 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a hard call man
[2016-07-20, 12:51:28 PM] Jamie: Yeah
‎[2016-07-20, 2:16:29 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-07-20, 2:16:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Whee
[2016-07-20, 3:33:01 PM] Jamie: Pretty darn cool. Nice colors!!
[2016-07-20, 3:34:08 PM] Rob Feeny: They even think I know what I'm doing!
[2016-07-20, 3:58:50 PM] Rob Feeny: You ok driving all the way to golden ears Park for a waterfall?
[2016-07-20, 3:59:05 PM] Rob Feeny: The one in Mission is not even a hike, it's just a short path
[2016-07-20, 4:05:56 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2016-07-20, 4:21:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Making the event. Looking at telling people to meet there 10am so we'd leave at 8:30
[2016-07-20, 4:21:31 PM] Rob Feeny: The work?
[2016-07-20, 4:21:54 PM] Jamie: Sorry is this Sunday?
[2016-07-20, 4:22:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. Later? Haha
[2016-07-20, 4:22:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe 11 would be better
[2016-07-20, 4:22:49 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm putting it on Meetup so we have at least the chance of a cute girl haha
[2016-07-20, 4:22:51 PM] Jamie: No that's fine. Just have to be back for ambreys bday. What's the drive time?
[2016-07-20, 4:22:57 PM] Jamie: Earlier is better
[2016-07-20, 4:23:00 PM] Rob Feeny: 1.5hrs
[2016-07-20, 4:23:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah was saying leave at 2:30ish
[2016-07-20, 4:23:30 PM] Jamie: Sounds good. Time to shower etc
[2016-07-20, 4:23:36 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a walk not a hike, 5.5k on a gravel path but a beautiful spot
[2016-07-20, 4:23:43 PM] Rob Feeny: And cool swimming holw
[2016-07-20, 4:31:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Join me at Come Swim In Gold Creek Falls With Us on Jul 24 at 10:00 AM: http://meetu.ps/e/BQnKh/tzPhP/d
[2016-07-20, 10:20:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow I didn't realize I was inviting 60 ppl :S
[2016-07-20, 10:21:00 PM] Rob Feeny: I was just tapping on people but I thought would be enjoyable to have there
[2016-07-20, 10:21:31 PM] Rob Feeny: A good chunk of them are people that I'm pretty sure won't come but I still get credit for inviting them
[2016-07-20, 10:27:25 PM] Jamie: All good. Will be lucky to get 30
[2016-07-20, 10:28:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Well you have to still invite people too!
[2016-07-20, 10:47:42 PM] Rob Feeny: What changed in that event for Mountain Equipment Co-op?
[2016-07-20, 10:47:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Just want to make sure I didn't miss something
[2016-07-20, 10:48:01 PM] Jamie: Add Kat to the invite
[2016-07-20, 10:48:10 PM] Jamie: Added*
[2016-07-20, 10:48:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-07-20, 10:48:55 PM] Jamie: She's looking for a couch for her new place. Somebody just asked me recently. Any idea of anyone getting rid of a couch?
[2016-07-20, 10:49:36 PM] Rob Feeny: No actually. I'm looking for one! And a freezer...
[2016-07-20, 10:58:49 PM] Jamie: Hey it looks like you forgot to invite Tana. Should I invite her?
[2016-07-20, 10:59:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup!
[2016-07-20, 10:59:31 PM] Rob Feeny: My fingers were getting tired. I invited Jeff, pretty much the same thing
[2016-07-21, 9:18:37 AM] Jamie: For the record toothpaste actually works on pimples.
[2016-07-21, 9:19:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Wild. I You mean that giant mountain on your face is gone?
[2016-07-21, 9:19:42 AM] Jamie: Not yet asshole. But at least it stopped growing
[2016-07-21, 9:20:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey until I get my abs back and look like you I need to drag myself up by pulling you down
[2016-07-21, 9:21:13 AM] Jamie: Honestly your chest and arms look pretty huge yesterday
[2016-07-21, 9:22:27 AM] Jamie: At our age you probably won't get your abs back in less you do a fat restricted diet and increase your H I IT
[2016-07-21, 9:40:17 AM] Rob Feeny: I've been using that pull up bar
[2016-07-21, 9:40:33 AM] Rob Feeny: And I'm just going to stick with my running for now haha. It's all I have the time or energy for
[2016-07-21, 3:20:58 PM] Rob Feeny: This is getting fucking ridiculous
[2016-07-22, 10:56:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Schletter can ship them to VREC or Rob Baxter has to confirm that they can ship them right to Jammy. Thoughts?
[2016-07-22, 10:56:29 AM] Rob Feeny: I'd probably say get Rob to confirm it
[2016-07-22, 11:07:09 AM] Rob Feeny: But they can ship them today
[2016-07-22, 12:36:36 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎Missed voice call
[2016-07-22, 12:36:35 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎Missed voice call
[2016-07-22, 12:38:55 PM] Jamie: Sorry busy
[2016-07-22, 12:40:55 PM] Rob Feeny: All good. Just asked Rob to confirm
[2016-07-22, 1:22:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Designer's draft. I like it, just need to give him copy and get the lighting / led part added
[2016-07-22, 1:22:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I didn't give him much to work with
‎[2016-07-22, 1:22:35 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-07-22, 2:47:19 PM] Jamie: I love it!
[2016-07-22, 2:48:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome. I'll work on getting the copy done this weekend
[2016-07-23, 2:58:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Should I bring the Dewalt radio?
[2016-07-23, 2:58:13 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-07-23, 2:58:36 PM] Jamie: This probably isn't as well organized as our events
[2016-07-23, 2:59:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok. Just loading the car
[2016-07-23, 3:02:01 PM] Rob Feeny: on my way.
[2016-07-23, 3:02:23 PM] Rob Feeny: I know you're tired of driving your big truck, do you want to take my car?
[2016-07-23, 3:03:05 PM] Jamie: Nah. The BBQ is kinda gross. And I want to pick up my shelter on the way home from Martins
[2016-07-23, 3:03:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yes forgot about that. There in a bit.
[2016-07-23, 3:13:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Downstairs
[2016-07-23, 3:14:05 PM] Jamie: I'm sitting in my truck
[2016-07-23, 9:33:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn the cute girl bailed
[2016-07-23, 9:37:07 PM] Jamie: Lame
[2016-07-23, 9:38:04 PM] Rob Feeny: At about 10pm I'm going to post that if they haven't posted, texted or spoken up in some way we'll assume that they aren't coming and not wait for them
[2016-07-23, 10:52:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey where are you picking up Kat? Was she coming to your place?
[2016-07-23, 10:54:47 PM] Jamie: She is coming here for 8:30. Wanna meet here at 8:30 too?
[2016-07-23, 10:55:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok just talking to that Dannielle lady about where to grab her
[2016-07-23, 10:56:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe Rupert station for 8:50? Google says 53 min to the parking lot
[2016-07-23, 10:57:18 PM] Jamie: Is Rupert convenient for us?
[2016-07-23, 10:57:55 PM] Rob Feeny: She'll go to any skytrain station, I'm just trying to see where is most convenient for us. Google says to take #1 from your place
[2016-07-24, 9:53:16 AM] Jamie: At Safeway. Need anything?
[2016-07-24, 9:53:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope thanks
[2016-07-26, 8:29:50 PM] Jamie: You left your vocal jacket in the truck
[2016-07-26, 8:44:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok thanks man

[2016-07-26, 9:05:27 PM] Jamie: Holy cow. This is a major ordeal
[2016-07-26, 10:36:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man you don't even understand. We finally got the last one placed and now the crane is stuck on the road

[2016-07-28, 11:11:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Here's the flyer at this point. I was thinking that the LED lighting and Lighting Control picture captions should be the same color background as the solar PV one and to put some bullet points on the items in each item in the bottom right corner
[2016-07-28, 11:24:52 AM] Jamie: I agree with both. And I love it. We need to find more uses for it. Once we get the final revision I will post to Facebook too
[2016-07-28, 11:29:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. We get the source files and all told it was about to $40 US
[2016-07-28, 11:40:30 AM] Jamie: Cool
[2016-07-28, 1:41:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Well I'm learning loads because the inverter isn't working haha
[2016-07-28, 1:44:20 PM] Jamie: Oh oh. Spare?
[2016-07-28, 1:44:38 PM] Jamie: Hahahahaha
[2016-07-28, 2:08:49 PM] Jamie: Hey I'll pay you 150 bucks to set up a mini class for my guys to teach them how to solder properly
[2016-07-28, 2:28:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2016-07-28, 2:31:36 PM] Jamie: Cool.  Jesses soldering looks like little mini explosions happened
[2016-07-28, 3:16:26 PM] Rob Feeny: We should stop at Kal Lake and go cliff jumping...
[2016-07-28, 4:45:40 PM] Jamie: Hey Jammy hasn't seen anything at his office yet. Do we know if there's a tracking number on that package?
[2016-07-28, 4:47:04 PM] Jamie: I'm getting some grief from the builder now
[2016-07-28, 5:03:55 PM] Rob Feeny: They're in Ontario and closed for the day. I'll email Jonathan but have no signal to call
[2016-07-28, 5:04:20 PM] Jamie: No problem. We can call the morning
[2016-07-28, 7:08:16 PM] Rob Feeny: The docs went to VREC. Rob has them.
[2016-07-28, 7:12:16 PM] Jamie: That figures, lol
[2016-07-28, 7:12:32 PM] Jamie: Tell Rob he should send me a bill
[2016-07-28, 7:20:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck. Rob has an auto reply saying he's out of the office until the 4th. I'll try David.
[2016-07-28, 7:24:57 PM] Jamie: I don't think anybody in the city is gonna be working tomorrow. I'm sure it can wait till the fourth
[2016-07-28, 7:25:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-07-28, 7:26:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Isn't it the Monday that's the holiday?
[2016-07-28, 7:28:51 PM] Jamie: Yup. But a 4 day weekend is common
[2016-07-28, 7:31:38 PM] Jamie: When do you get back?
[2016-07-28, 7:33:54 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm on the ferry right now. Have to transit from Tsawwassen to my car in North Van so probably 9:30
[2016-07-28, 8:26:55 PM] Rob Feeny: What time do you want to roll out in the am?
[2016-07-28, 8:38:31 PM] Jamie: 6
[2016-07-28, 8:39:04 PM] Jamie: Meeting Laura in between 10:30-11 and pick up a bunch of stuff at Dads
[2016-07-28, 8:39:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-07-28, 8:39:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Just gotta get home and wash clothes
[2016-07-28, 10:31:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to save me an hour on the bus by running me over the bridge to north want to save me an hour on the bus by running them over the bridge to Vancouver at 920ish?
[2016-07-28, 10:32:24 PM] Rob Feeny: It's 8 minutes from your place
[2016-07-28, 10:35:52 PM] Jamie: Not sure I understand. You can take my truck but I have been drinking.
[2016-07-28, 10:36:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn. My car is at the shop in North Vancouver. I might just walk from your place because it would take an hour extra on the bus together
[2016-07-28, 10:37:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I missed a bus at the ferry terminal
[2016-07-28, 10:37:32 PM] Jamie: Crappy.  Tight schedule.
[2016-07-28, 10:38:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. I couldn't fly back with my camping gear
[2016-07-28, 10:42:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I think I'll just take a bus to near your house and grab a cab because it takes 3 bus connections to get to north van
[2016-07-29, 12:29:59 AM] Jamie: At your place for 6 then coffee and hit the road?
[2016-07-29, 12:30:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Sounds good.
[2016-07-29, 12:30:38 AM] Rob Feeny: Can we hit a grocery store along the way? I still need grapes. Etc
[2016-07-29, 12:31:32 AM] Jamie: Grocery store and beer store in Dilworth.
[2016-07-29, 12:32:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Sounds perfect
[2016-07-29, 12:33:19 AM] Jamie: Ugg. It's early but its worth getting to the cabin at 1pm and having some day
[2016-07-29, 12:33:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah I just need to do all my laundry and repack my bag
[2016-07-29, 12:34:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Took me 7 hours to get home because I had too much stuff to fly. But I can bill for most of that
[2016-07-29, 12:34:34 AM] Jamie: Wow. Still a really cool experience
[2016-07-29, 12:34:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Totally. And about 48 hours logged in 4 days
[2016-07-29, 12:36:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Plus $140 per diem and free food and beer the whole time
[2016-07-29, 7:27:14 AM] Jamie: Morning
[2016-07-29, 7:38:12 AM] Jamie: You up?
[2016-07-29, 7:39:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Morning
[2016-07-29, 7:39:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Was in the shower
[2016-07-29, 7:39:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey do you still have my little fishing kit?
[2016-07-29, 7:41:01 AM] Jamie: I can check my truck. I know it made it into my truck. I thought I brought it in and either gave it to you at Dans or at your place
[2016-07-29, 7:43:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm ok I don't remember. I'll take a look. I'm about 5 min behind btw
[2016-07-29, 7:47:16 AM] Jamie: That's ok. As revenge for your lateness I have bad gas, lol
[2016-07-29, 7:48:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok found it
[2016-07-29, 7:49:02 AM] Rob Feeny: And fuck you
[2016-07-29, 7:50:27 AM] Jamie: Ok great. I was super careful about making sure you got it back.
[2016-07-29, 7:59:37 AM] Jamie: Going to have to store some stuff in the shed I think
[2016-07-29, 8:03:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Ready when you are
[2016-07-29, 8:04:25 AM] Jamie: Two minutes
[2016-08-01, 9:35:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm thinking my missing toiletries kit may have spent the entire weekend in your canopy side compartment
[2016-08-01, 10:16:27 PM] Jamie: Haha ok. Want it?
[2016-08-01, 10:17:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah how early are you going to bed? Might hop on the bike and rip over for 9?
[2016-08-02, 10:45:07 AM] Jamie: Where did you go?
[2016-08-02, 3:06:56 PM] Jamie: Icbc is going to give me $18,500 for the van
[2016-08-02, 3:07:29 PM] Jamie: I think I only pay 21,000 tax in
[2016-08-02, 3:09:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice!
[2016-08-02, 3:09:48 PM] Rob Feeny: That probably makes your day
[2016-08-02, 3:10:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Damnit the only reasonable roommate option so far is a fairly cute 21yr old and that's not a smart decision
[2016-08-02, 3:23:18 PM] Jamie: Haha
[2016-08-02, 9:49:10 PM] Jamie: We have approval for you to deal with the bikes
[2016-08-02, 9:50:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha awesome
[2016-08-02, 9:50:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks
[2016-08-02, 9:55:33 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm here a few minutes early
[2016-08-02, 9:55:55 PM] Jamie: Wrong person?
[2016-08-02, 9:56:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yup
[2016-08-03, 9:17:37 AM] Jamie: How did your date go?
[2016-08-03, 9:28:43 AM] Rob Feeny: It actually went pretty well. she's a cool girl.
[2016-08-03, 9:29:02 AM] Jamie: The Brazilian?
[2016-08-03, 9:29:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Not sure where it's going to go but at the very least she's attractive and enjoyable to hang out with
[2016-08-03, 9:29:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2016-08-03, 8:02:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I just got in trouble with Morgan for "not letting him know that I had to leave early" because I was trying to be home for 7:30pm, meaning I could only work 11.5 hours.
[2016-08-03, 8:03:28 PM] Rob Feeny: So I'm taking transit home instead of driving the van back to Fairmont and getting my car. I'll have to the transit to my car tomorrow or I wouldn't have gotten home until 8:30, all because he decided to condense a two day job into one...
[2016-08-03, 9:27:29 PM] Jamie: Crazy. What are you doing at 7:30?
[2016-08-03, 9:28:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Had someone coming to look at the suite. Plus needed to clean before they came. Another person is coming later.
[2016-08-03, 9:29:05 PM] Rob Feeny: It's just frustrating when "can you a two day job" turns into "can you work a 15hr day and a 4 hour night shift the next day"
[2016-08-03, 9:29:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Because I said I could work tomorrow day or tomorrow night but not both
[2016-08-03, 9:29:44 PM] Jamie: Yeah his lack of planning drove me nuts
[2016-08-03, 9:31:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. I think I reacted to the mom style "ask to do one task and then expand that task"..
[2016-08-03, 9:33:34 PM] Jamie: Yeah probably a little bit. But it's really annoying
[2016-08-04, 11:19:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey next time you are in your elevator can you send me a snap of that memo about the bikes?
[2016-08-04, 11:25:30 AM] Jamie: Email
[2016-08-04, 11:26:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Thx
[2016-08-04, 11:27:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha ok so the deadline has already passed. I'll get on it today to find a charity. Tomorrow I'll connect with you to get in there and see what's untagged
[2016-08-04, 11:28:01 AM] Jamie: I looked yesterday. Looks like only 3 bikes untagged
[2016-08-04, 11:28:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Awesome thanks
[2016-08-04, 2:58:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Haven't forgotten about you needing to finish off gear. Not sure when I'm done with Morgan tonight but if not early, sort it tomorrow day?
[2016-08-04, 2:58:33 PM] Jamie: I bought it all with Kat yesterday.
[2016-08-04, 3:01:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome
[2016-08-04, 10:49:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey have you been by Dan's recently? There's a check from Westcoast AV galleries there
[2016-08-04, 11:22:13 PM] Jamie: Oh no I haven't. Thx
[2016-08-05, 8:26:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Should be there for 7
[2016-08-05, 9:04:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Or not. Accident on commercial
[2016-08-05, 9:12:02 PM] Jamie: All good. 27 out of 55 so far
[2016-08-06, 8:58:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Just putting stuff in the car. Coffee order?
[2016-08-06, 8:58:53 AM] Jamie: Just a small black coffee and a large cup for me please
[2016-08-06, 8:59:07 AM] Rob Feeny: And for Kat?
[2016-08-06, 9:00:23 AM] Jamie: Nothing g
[2016-08-06, 9:01:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Pike?
[2016-08-06, 9:01:49 AM] Jamie: Sure
[2016-08-06, 9:07:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay I'm going to be a little bit late. I need gas and to poop
[2016-08-06, 9:12:16 AM] Jamie: Ok.
[2016-08-08, 11:34:13 AM] Jamie: Safari is toast. It died Friday afternoon and repair place says in of the valves is bent and seized. Two vans down in less that 4 weeks
[2016-08-08, 11:50:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Fuck.
[2016-08-08, 11:50:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Take my car for a while
[2016-08-08, 12:24:50 PM] Jamie: Thanks man. I am trying to work a deal for 2 almost new vans. I lose a lot in the first year but the bank is more likely to lend me $40k to do it.
[2016-08-08, 12:28:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch
[2016-08-08, 2:53:00 PM] Jamie: How do you feel?
[2016-08-08, 2:53:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn sore
[2016-08-08, 2:53:32 PM] Rob Feeny: You?
[2016-08-08, 2:53:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Going to a yoga. Class tonight
[2016-08-08, 2:54:10 PM] Jamie: My traps are sore and I've got one tiny blister on my big toe. Other than that I'm fine
[2016-08-08, 2:54:51 PM] Jamie: Considering how sore my feet were yesterday at the end of it I can't believe they don't hurt today
[2016-08-08, 2:59:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah only the side of one big toe hurts.. But my quads and calves are sore
[2016-08-08, 2:59:24 PM] Jamie: I bet
[2016-08-08, 3:01:43 PM] Rob Feeny: I really want a nap tho
[2016-08-08, 3:03:12 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-08-08, 3:09:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Might have to take a coffee nap
[2016-08-08, 3:09:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Could I borrow your truck to take those bikes to my place tonight? I want to hang onto them for a week or so before donating anything, just in case
[2016-08-08, 3:10:56 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-08-08, 3:11:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome thanks.
[2016-08-08, 3:44:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Gimme 5 min
[2016-08-08, 3:58:59 PM] Rob Feeny: I was in a seminar. What's up?
[2016-08-08, 4:00:31 PM] Jamie: I might have a job for you. You can call me back if you have a second to chat
[2016-08-08, 6:53:24 PM] Jamie: Call me when you can
[2016-08-08, 7:18:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Tried. I'm free whenever you are.
[2016-08-08, 9:24:55 PM] Jamie: Want food? Omelet type thing
[2016-08-08, 9:28:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2016-08-08, 9:28:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks
[2016-08-08, 9:47:56 PM] Jamie: Five minutes to food
[2016-08-08, 10:46:14 PM] Rob Feeny: So Dan thinks those Diamondbacks for probably $1,000 each when they were new
[2016-08-08, 10:46:29 PM] Rob Feeny: The mountain bike one has all sorts of upgraded parts and is quite light
[2016-08-08, 10:46:40 PM] Jamie: Wow
[2016-08-08, 11:13:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay all bikes dealt with I'm going to stop at yoga then come to your place
[2016-08-08, 11:13:24 PM] Rob Feeny: I grabbed all your mail from Dan's house and there are two checks
[2016-08-08, 11:13:41 PM] Jamie: Sweet
[2016-08-08, 11:14:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Actually there is one from insure BC that looks like it could be a check to
[2016-08-09, 1:04:15 AM] Rob Feeny: Rise and shine mofo!
[2016-08-09, 1:04:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha sorry to wake you
[2016-08-09, 1:04:46 AM] Jamie: Sup
[2016-08-09, 1:04:56 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm outside your door
[2016-08-09, 1:05:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Got cheques and keys for you
[2016-08-09, 9:35:53 AM] Jamie: Good to go at Toyota when you get here
[2016-08-09, 9:36:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay I am on 1st Ave
[2016-08-09, 9:36:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Probably 5 minutes
[2016-08-09, 9:43:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay so I lied. Traffic just keeps getting worse
[2016-08-09, 2:24:06 PM] Jamie: Call me about van
[2016-08-09, 3:20:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry I had my phone on airplane to help me focus. I'm here now. I tried calling.
[2016-08-09, 3:25:41 PM] Rob Feeny: If you send me the specs I can start calling around
[2016-08-09, 4:01:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Cloverdale auto repair seems to be in Surrey, that sound right?
[2016-08-09, 4:02:16 PM] Jamie: Yep. Same thing
[2016-08-09, 4:07:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Aluminum rims?
[2016-08-09, 4:07:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Or steel?
[2016-08-09, 4:07:53 PM] Jamie: Steel
[2016-08-09, 4:12:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Looking at only. Around 80
[2016-08-09, 4:12:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Trying a few
[2016-08-09, 4:13:01 PM] Jamie: If it's not worth it will just let her take care of it
[2016-08-09, 4:13:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-08-09, 4:13:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah just got offered 60
[2016-08-09, 4:13:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Let her have the cash for beer money haha
[2016-08-09, 4:14:02 PM] Rob Feeny: I remember Stu paying more for one but maybe it's too old now. They usually want them for parts, not the metal
[2016-08-09, 6:28:39 PM] Jamie: Where should I park?
[2016-08-09, 6:29:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Out front
[2016-08-09, 6:29:36 PM] Jamie: Yeah Anna has taken both spots. I will see if i can wedge in
[2016-08-09, 6:29:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok there is usually three out front
[2016-08-09, 6:30:10 PM] Jamie: Yeah it will fit
[2016-08-09, 6:30:17 PM] Jamie: My truck will definitely not, ha ha
[2016-08-09, 6:32:56 PM] Jamie: Keys are in the front mailbox
[2016-08-09, 6:34:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man
[2016-08-09, 7:03:30 PM] Jamie: Man cab companies need to die. 15 minutes on hold to have a dispatcher lie about how long it's going to take. When I tried to cancel because I don't have time anymore to make it to grab my truck, they said he's 2 min away and they will bill the Toyota dealership either way. 10 minutes later he arrives. I'm in the cab and I am never going to make it to grab my rental before 6
[2016-08-09, 7:03:45 PM] Jamie: Had they told me the truth, I would have found another way
[2016-08-09, 7:04:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Think of the types that end up working at a cab company...
[2016-08-09, 7:04:42 PM] Jamie: Yeah. We need more options
[2016-08-09, 7:04:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Uber
[2016-08-09, 8:19:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you make itl
[2016-08-09, 8:19:37 PM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2016-08-09, 8:19:57 PM] Jamie: Yup. 5:56
[2016-08-09, 8:21:30 PM] Jamie: Now I am on my way back in a cab to grab my truck from the rental place because I didn't have time to stop the truck first. But... almost done
[2016-08-09, 8:21:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuuuuck. What a pain
[2016-08-09, 8:23:02 PM] Rob Feeny: And you're still down one vehicle
[2016-08-09, 8:23:23 PM] Rob Feeny: After I get Hailee to the train tomorrow I won't need my car, if it would help
[2016-08-09, 8:23:26 PM] Jamie: Yeah. Oh well, that's life
[2016-08-09, 8:23:41 PM] Jamie: Nah I have a rental now
[2016-08-09, 8:26:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool
[2016-08-09, 9:59:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Just met the regional sales manager for Canadian solae
[2016-08-09, 9:59:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Solar
[2016-08-09, 11:01:23 PM] Jamie: Cool.
[2016-08-10, 2:49:05 PM] Rob Feeny: So tomorrow am I'll coordinate with Kris and Rob Baxter and get the install scheduled. How far out are your guys booking?
[2016-08-10, 2:49:30 PM] Jamie: Of just the mounts?
[2016-08-10, 2:49:53 PM] Jamie: Or the racking too?
[2016-08-10, 2:49:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Well is there any reason we can't install everything?
[2016-08-10, 2:50:05 PM] Jamie: Nope
[2016-08-10, 2:50:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Rob says he keeps the racking/panels in stock
[2016-08-10, 2:53:17 PM] Jamie: Do we have to cover the panels if we don't have anywhere to take electricity?
[2016-08-10, 2:54:18 PM] Rob Feeny: No, the ones for WCO sat for quite a quite. What's the status of the electrical?
[2016-08-10, 2:55:33 PM] Jamie: We have the architect inspecting our boxing next week to give us approval for wiring
[2016-08-10, 2:55:52 PM] Jamie: Within a couple of weeks we can have a system in place to put that electricity back into the grid
[2016-08-10, 2:56:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Research says there's no issue at all but I'll double check with Rob
[2016-08-10, 4:53:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey thanks for gassing up my car man
[2016-08-10, 4:54:42 PM] Rob Feeny: And I haven't forgot about the hundred and fifty bucks I owe you. I'm still waiting for Westcoast outbuildings to pay me.
[2016-08-10, 4:57:40 PM] Jamie: All good. Haha of course Rob Baxter might not have the racking, lol
[2016-08-10, 5:00:27 PM] Jamie: If you have a chance, Brad is keen to talk about that potential solar job
[2016-08-10, 5:02:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Of course. It was David that said they had stuff in stock, but Rob was the one saying he spec'd the racking from stock not an individual order
[2016-08-10, 5:48:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Going to shut my phone off for a few hours, I've already talked to Brad
[2016-08-10, 5:50:11 PM] Jamie: Another nap? Lol
[2016-08-10, 5:50:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope,  a date...
[2016-08-10, 9:55:32 PM] Rob Feeny: What are you up to this evening?
[2016-08-10, 9:56:14 PM] Jamie: Drinking beer with Morgan at my place
[2016-08-10, 9:56:28 PM] Jamie: He's probably leaving soon and I haven't eaten
[2016-08-10, 9:56:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha ok, just on my way to my car. Want to go get food? I'd be half an hour tho
[2016-08-10, 9:57:12 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2016-08-10, 9:57:22 PM] Jamie: I probably can't drive
[2016-08-10, 9:58:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow actually Google says 45min to my car which is at 49th Ave stn
[2016-08-10, 9:58:15 PM] Rob Feeny: So maybe it's not worth waiting
[2016-08-10, 10:06:59 PM] Jamie: Text me when you are close. He might not leave for a bit
[2016-08-10, 10:41:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm only a few minutes away
[2016-08-10, 10:41:18 PM] Jamie: Perfect timings
[2016-08-10, 10:41:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to come down to the parking
[2016-08-10, 10:41:47 PM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2016-08-10, 10:41:59 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2016-08-10, 10:43:43 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm at the side
[2016-08-11, 5:31:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck some days are tough
[2016-08-11, 5:31:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I just want to crawl back in bed
[2016-08-11, 5:57:36 PM] Jamie: Yeah me too. Very tough day.
[2016-08-11, 6:02:08 PM] Jamie: Why are you having a hard day?
[2016-08-11, 6:02:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Just one of those days where nothing is getting done. Been working since 7 and haven't accomplished much. How about you?
[2016-08-11, 6:05:35 PM] Jamie: I went to the bank for business loan advice and she treated me like a chump.
[2016-08-11, 6:06:22 PM] Jamie: I'm trying to figure out how to structure the purchase of these two vans to give me the ability to also get a business line of credit in the next six months. And I only wanted on the business side so that it doesn't affect my personal lending power. I went into talk to her about business loans and she said that unless I have all of my documents with me she wasn't going to talk to me
[2016-08-11, 6:07:07 PM] Jamie: I tried to talk to my accountant about it and they don't really want to comment on anything but taxation. So I went to GM dealership and they didn't want to offer me any advice either.
[2016-08-11, 6:07:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Fucking hell
[2016-08-11, 6:07:53 PM] Rob Feeny: And what are "all of your documents"?
[2016-08-11, 6:09:59 PM] Jamie: Corporate financial statements from the accountant for the last two years. I just found out when I looked for them that John didn't send them.
[2016-08-11, 6:10:14 PM] Jamie: I am also waiting for my 2015 personal assessment
[2016-08-11, 6:10:36 PM] Jamie: I have all of these numbers I just don't have the official documents. She would not work with anything less than the official documents even see radically
[2016-08-11, 6:11:10 PM] Jamie: I had two people try to call me to take credit card payments today and I'm too busy to do it, ha ha
[2016-08-11, 6:13:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha damnit
[2016-08-11, 6:13:28 PM] Rob Feeny: It never ends

[2016-08-11, 9:41:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes
[2016-08-11, 9:42:28 PM] Jamie: Nice. It's actually for Brent's son for a working job interview. Is that ok? I will replace if anything happens
[2016-08-11, 9:42:44 PM] Jamie: Could I send Brent to grab it somewhere?
[2016-08-11, 9:42:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2016-08-11, 9:43:19 PM] Rob Feeny: I can put it outside my back door and it will be there whenever he wants to swing by
[2016-08-11, 9:43:35 PM] Jamie: Thanks!
[2016-08-11, 10:06:44 PM] Jamie: Brent will swing be in a bit. The says thanks

[2016-08-12, 2:00:29 PM] Rob Feeny: How's today going?
[2016-08-12, 2:30:00 PM] Jamie: Busy as hell. But... I have 2 vans!
[2016-08-12, 2:30:44 PM] Jamie: I got approved for in house leading for both, only under the company name, and they don't report the lease to the credit bureau unless I default
[2016-08-12, 2:34:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck yah man!
[2016-08-12, 2:34:40 PM] Rob Feeny: That's awesome
[2016-08-12, 2:35:21 PM] Jamie: Yeah it's a relief. And only need $5000 down each instead of $12,500
[2016-08-12, 2:35:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm happy for you man
[2016-08-12, 2:35:57 PM] Jamie: Thanks. Hows your day?
[2016-08-12, 2:36:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Meh. Drove all the way to Langley to get 2.5hrs of work with Morgan, but at least I got lunch out of it
[2016-08-12, 2:36:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Now I'm heading home to finish some odds and ends
[2016-08-12, 2:55:27 PM] Jamie: Not bad for a Friday
[2016-08-12, 2:56:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. I'm just so sluggish I've resorted to Redbull
[2016-08-12, 2:57:40 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm right by Superstore. Can you think of anything off the top of your head we need for the party?
[2016-08-12, 2:57:58 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm already going to look for the small clear plastic cups
[2016-08-12, 2:58:31 PM] Jamie: Nice. I need one more tiki torch and some fuel from Canadian tire?
[2016-08-12, 3:07:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'll be going past there
[2016-08-12, 4:19:46 PM] Rob Feeny: So I told Brad I could have a proposal for him a week from Monday.. The clock is ticking. You have some time Sunday to sit down with me?
[2016-08-12, 4:20:06 PM] Jamie: Sure
‎[2016-08-12, 5:05:49 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-12, 5:05:57 PM] Rob Feeny: That's all they have, for 20$ I think
[2016-08-12, 5:09:29 PM] Jamie: Nah doesn't math
[2016-08-12, 5:09:31 PM] Jamie: Match
[2016-08-12, 5:11:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay. They're actually only 8 bucks but now I'm on the hunt for Tiki oil
[2016-08-12, 7:34:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to tell Rob Wednesday of next week? I committed to Morgan but had advised him the solar takes precedent
[2016-08-12, 7:57:07 PM] Jamie: Wednesday for install?
[2016-08-12, 7:57:24 PM] Jamie: I don't think rob has the racking
[2016-08-12, 7:58:13 PM] Jamie: Are you already home? I'd like a ride to Jean's party if possible

[2016-08-12, 9:22:07 PM] Jamie: Are you barbecuing?
[2016-08-12, 9:27:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Not really
[2016-08-12, 9:27:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Hadn't even thought about food to be honest
[2016-08-12, 9:27:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Jane did minimal planning or prep
[2016-08-12, 9:27:28 PM] Rob Feeny: We could though
[2016-08-12, 9:27:52 PM] Jamie: Ok I am getting dropped off at Safeway to grab food. I'm hungry. I also have no booze. Have anything?
[2016-08-12, 9:28:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Not really. 2 beers and few ounces of vodka. Not drinking much tonight
[2016-08-12, 9:28:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I could wander down and we could grab something, haul Dan's BBQ out
[2016-08-12, 9:28:53 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2016-08-12, 9:32:00 PM] Jamie: I'm at Safeway if you want something
[2016-08-12, 9:32:16 PM] Jamie: Or I can go bug people at Starbucks until you get it
[2016-08-12, 9:32:22 PM] Jamie: Here*
[2016-08-12, 9:32:28 PM] Rob Feeny: just walking right now
[2016-08-12, 9:32:58 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm still a block and a half away though so its up hit up Starbucks
[2016-08-12, 9:34:00 PM] Jamie: I will cruise the aisles for chicks
[2016-08-12, 9:34:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha
[2016-08-13, 10:43:19 AM] Jamie: Looks like just cutlery. I don't see any plates or cups
‎[2016-08-13, 10:43:39 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-13, 12:01:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, I got 50 plastic cups. They're 16oz ones cos I couldn't find small. Clear ones
[2016-08-13, 12:02:18 PM] Jamie: I'm sure that will be fine. I will have to fill my freezer with ice I guess.
[2016-08-13, 12:02:45 PM] Jamie: What time did you party until?
[2016-08-13, 12:03:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I  can bring my big cooler and small one
[2016-08-13, 12:03:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Anna has a punch bowl I am going to try to borrow
[2016-08-13, 12:04:03 PM] Jamie: Great. Need me to get anything?
[2016-08-13, 12:04:24 PM] Rob Feeny: I was in bed by 1am
[2016-08-13, 12:04:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Just ran Burnaby Mountain
[2016-08-13, 12:04:37 PM] Jamie: Nice!
[2016-08-13, 12:04:45 PM] Jamie: I wish. I haven't run in a week
[2016-08-13, 12:04:54 PM] Rob Feeny: I also got Napkins and cutlery . We need plates
[2016-08-13, 12:05:10 PM] Jamie: I have so much plastic cutlery
[2016-08-13, 12:05:14 PM] Jamie: I can grab plates
[2016-08-13, 12:05:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok well I spent 1.99 on it
[2016-08-13, 12:22:51 PM] Rob Feeny: I have the stuff and the torch oil in my car
[2016-08-13, 12:29:02 PM] Jamie: Cool.  What are you going to do today?
[2016-08-13, 12:29:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Recycling with Dan and helping the neighbors fix their fence
[2016-08-13, 12:31:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I have blueberries, frozen raspberries and frozen blackberries for sangria btw
[2016-08-13, 12:32:19 PM] Jamie: Perfect. I have 2 bottles of wine but it looks like one has been opened. Hoe many more should I grab?
[2016-08-13, 12:35:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe another red and a white?
[2016-08-13, 12:45:54 PM] Jamie: Ok. I will see what I can for $11, haha
[2016-08-13, 12:49:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Cheap is fine!
[2016-08-13, 1:11:42 PM] Jamie: Haha I didn't even notice that the invite was for 4pm! That's so early
[2016-08-13, 1:12:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Whoops. I think it made sense at the time. Want to post about that? I didn't think people would show up too early. Probably 5
[2016-08-13, 1:13:58 PM] Jamie: Even 5 is early. Before dinner means we have to provide food or people will leave to eat. I will change it to 6?
[2016-08-13, 1:16:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2016-08-13, 1:32:37 PM] Jamie: I'm glad it's not outrageously hot today. My place would be a sweatbox by the time of the party
[2016-08-13, 1:34:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha, true. I can bring a fan from Dan's
[2016-08-13, 1:34:39 PM] Jamie: It's all good I have a giant fan
[2016-08-13, 1:34:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome
[2016-08-13, 1:37:08 PM] Jamie: Where did you get the garbage bag holders? I think we need a recycling and garbage in each area
[2016-08-13, 1:37:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Home depot
[2016-08-13, 1:38:02 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2016-08-13, 1:38:08 PM] Rob Feeny: We're headed there after recycling. Want two more?
[2016-08-13, 2:30:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Want me to grab those bag stands?
[2016-08-13, 2:32:00 PM] Jamie: Sure. I also need a whisk broom. The old school style. My big broom doesn't sweep the deck very well
[2016-08-13, 2:32:04 PM] Jamie: I have cash
[2016-08-13, 2:33:48 PM] Jamie: Is it corn whisk?
[2016-08-13, 2:34:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I know what you mean. But a full sized broom?
[2016-08-13, 2:34:19 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-08-13, 2:34:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok.
[2016-08-13, 2:34:56 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll look for a Tiki torch
[2016-08-13, 2:48:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Does that match?

[2016-08-13, 2:49:45 PM] Jamie: Not quite. It's ok. It's not the end of the world if we are one short lol
[2016-08-13, 2:49:48 PM] Rob Feeny: How about we try for this one haha. This is the only option. It's okay
[2016-08-13, 2:49:59 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2016-08-13, 2:50:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow voice to text fail. I was suggesting using a brown Sharpie on it. But that's fine we can go without it
[2016-08-13, 2:50:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Will give some drunk girl a Sharpie and put her to work
[2016-08-13, 2:50:24 PM] Jamie: Haha
[2016-08-13, 2:51:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay I have bag stands and a tiki torch
[2016-08-13, 2:52:13 PM] Jamie: Cool. Garbage bags? I think my box is at storage
[2016-08-13, 2:52:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay I've got lots.
[2016-08-13, 2:52:32 PM] Jamie: Perfect
[2016-08-13, 3:42:46 PM] Jamie: What time are you going to head over to my place?
[2016-08-13, 3:44:09 PM] Rob Feeny: I was thinking around 4?
[2016-08-13, 3:44:20 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2016-08-13, 3:44:29 PM] Jamie: We have to test out the sangria of course
[2016-08-13, 3:44:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yup
[2016-08-13, 3:47:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck Jane had no idea what is and isn't hers
[2016-08-13, 3:49:04 PM] Jamie: That doesn't surprise me
[2016-08-13, 5:28:11 PM] Jamie: It's roasting in my place. Probably should bring that fan
[2016-08-13, 5:28:29 PM] Jamie: Should I go grab a couple bags of ice too?
[2016-08-13, 5:31:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I'm just eating a hot dog with Dan then heading your way
‎[2016-08-13, 5:35:15 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted

[2016-08-13, 6:09:20 PM] Rob Feeny: and a ton of red Solo cups
[2016-08-13, 6:09:58 PM] Jamie: Of course!
[2016-08-13, 6:17:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay, I am bringing two coolers with some frozen fruit, wine, limeade, cups and plates, camp chair three bag holders and Punchbowl plus a fan
[2016-08-13, 6:18:29 PM] Jamie: Perfect. Once you get here i might sneak out and get a watermelon and some ice
[2016-08-13, 6:18:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Want me to grab them on the way?
[2016-08-13, 6:18:51 PM] Jamie: That would be awesome
[2016-08-13, 6:19:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Jane has almost an entire watermelon sitting here... I don't think she's using it
[2016-08-13, 6:19:21 PM] Jamie: Yoink!
‎[2016-08-13, 6:22:39 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-13, 6:35:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you have oil and vinegar at your place?
[2016-08-13, 6:36:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha we totally put this as a pot luck too. Were we drinking?
[2016-08-13, 6:36:41 PM] Jamie: I have oil and vinegar

[2016-08-13, 6:37:04 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2016-08-13, 6:37:10 PM] Rob Feeny: K

[2016-08-13, 6:41:42 PM] Jamie: Sweet. I need the rind only
[2016-08-13, 6:56:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll be at your place in 3 or 4 minutes. Want to meet me at the side door?
[2016-08-13, 6:56:48 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-08-14, 12:02:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow I just woke up.
[2016-08-14, 12:02:56 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm still so damn tired
[2016-08-14, 12:03:27 PM] Jamie: What time did you go to bed?
[2016-08-14, 12:03:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Soon as I got home last night
[2016-08-14, 12:03:53 PM] Rob Feeny: We left 1 I think?
[2016-08-14, 12:04:15 PM] Rob Feeny: 9 hours for me is a hell of a lot of sleep
[2016-08-14, 12:04:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, 8.5
[2016-08-14, 12:04:33 PM] Jamie: Sounds about right. Maybe the Burnaby Mountain run took it out of you
[2016-08-14, 12:04:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I think so
[2016-08-14, 12:05:11 PM] Rob Feeny: My legs are pretty sore
[2016-08-14, 12:05:27 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm going to shower and eat and bus down there to help sort stuff out
[2016-08-14, 12:06:31 PM] Jamie: I wouldn't worry about it man. Gala helped me clean up last night and I just took the last of the garbage down now. Other than all of the perishables that you're going to get donated to you  and the stuff you left behind there's nothing to do
[2016-08-14, 12:06:40 PM] Jamie: Della*
[2016-08-14, 12:07:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow
[2016-08-14, 12:07:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Well I have a bunch of stuff to pick up at least
[2016-08-14, 12:07:30 PM] Rob Feeny: You hitting Starbucks?
[2016-08-14, 12:07:40 PM] Rob Feeny: I need to buy Della a coffee or two!
[2016-08-14, 12:07:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks guys
[2016-08-14, 12:08:09 PM] Jamie: Yeah. I thought Della was angling to be the last person there trying to hit on me but soon as we're done cleaning she beat feet.
[2016-08-14, 12:08:25 PM] Jamie: And yup justify to Starbucks
[2016-08-14, 12:08:32 PM] Jamie: Ok typing hard
[2016-08-14, 12:10:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha see ya there
‎[2016-08-14, 2:23:10 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-14, 2:26:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha love it!
[2016-08-14, 2:27:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Boots might help
[2016-08-14, 2:33:24 PM] Jamie: Ok so a chocolate chip cookie to star my day does not feel healthier than the last 2 days, hah
[2016-08-14, 2:36:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahahaha
[2016-08-14, 2:36:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm headed to Starbucks for a Frappuccino so...
[2016-08-14, 2:36:52 PM] Jamie: I was there and gone. I moved to cafe Artigiano to sit in the sun
[2016-08-14, 2:37:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice. Maybe I'll stop by when I'm bussing down to your place.
[2016-08-14, 2:37:34 PM] Rob Feeny: How are the girls?
[2016-08-14, 2:38:23 PM] Jamie: Terrible. Starbucks was better but I can only handle the AC for a while before I am freezing
[2016-08-14, 2:38:42 PM] Jamie: Some hot ones walk by here every once in a while
[2016-08-14, 2:40:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok bike shops aren't cheap. They're servicing that bike and repairing the tires but it's $100
[2016-08-14, 2:41:24 PM] Rob Feeny: But that still a cheap price for a bike in Wicked shape
[2016-08-14, 2:41:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Man I don't know why Google Voice to Text loves to randomly capitalize words
[2016-08-14, 2:42:07 PM] Jamie: Yes. And they are a boutique  bike shop i.e. Expensive
[2016-08-14, 2:42:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Well I could walk there carrying the bike haha lesson learned.
[2016-08-14, 3:03:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Starbucks had zero cute girls, not even any cute staff
[2016-08-14, 4:34:46 PM] Rob Feeny: You still at Artigiano? I forgot to give you your cash
[2016-08-14, 4:35:54 PM] Jamie: At pita pit. Back at my place in about 10 min. Want to go for a swim at that outdoor pool?
[2016-08-14, 4:37:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Where's that?
[2016-08-14, 4:37:37 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd be game. Can you spot me a towel?
[2016-08-14, 4:37:56 PM] Jamie: Yup. The park we went to for charlottes BBQ
[2016-08-14, 4:38:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok. Sweet. I know there are several in Burnaby as well
[2016-08-14, 4:38:41 PM] Jamie: New Brighton?
[2016-08-14, 4:39:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I'm outside your place right now. None of the stores I wanted to visit were open
[2016-08-14, 4:39:32 PM] Jamie: OK driving your way
‎[2016-08-14, 9:40:50 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-14, 9:41:17 PM] Jamie: Nasty
[2016-08-15, 10:45:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Fuck me that's a complicated roof
[2016-08-15, 10:47:23 AM] Jamie: Haha.
[2016-08-15, 10:47:42 AM] Jamie: I had an awesome start to my day. I dropped my whole key ring down the elevator shaft
[2016-08-15, 10:50:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Holy shit how does that even happen?
[2016-08-15, 10:51:14 AM] Jamie: In slow motion, that's how, lol
[2016-08-15, 10:51:40 AM] Jamie: Lucky Jesse had a key to my place and I have a spare rental car key and fob
[2016-08-15, 10:51:50 AM] Jamie: Elevator guys will get them today. $200
[2016-08-15, 10:53:15 AM] Rob Feeny: Ouch
[2016-08-15, 10:53:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Not cool. I'm shocked the gap is big enough to let them through
[2016-08-15, 10:54:07 AM] Jamie: Yeah. I thought I was so fucked but other than sleeping for another 45min in my hallway waiting for Jesse, it was manageable.
[2016-08-15, 10:58:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha always look on the bright side...
[2016-08-15, 3:50:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Busy?
[2016-08-15, 3:50:36 PM] Jamie: Just sitting down with Nica to work on stuff. What's up?
[2016-08-15, 3:50:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Got 3 min to talk about that solar proposal?
[2016-08-15, 3:50:59 PM] Rob Feeny: And are you ok for a driver?
[2016-08-15, 7:07:18 PM] Jamie: Shawn just got into an accident in my truck he rear-ended someone
[2016-08-15, 7:08:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy christ man
[2016-08-15, 7:08:28 PM] Rob Feeny: What a month. Not cool
[2016-08-15, 7:12:46 PM] Rob Feeny: How bad is it?
[2016-08-15, 7:21:09 PM] Jamie: Don't know yet
[2016-08-15, 9:14:01 PM] Jamie: I don't get it. Sean gets into an accident and I dealt with it. I did get irritated and raised my voice when he said he rear ended someone but it wasn't his fault. So I tell him to take pictures and write a report and send it to me immediately. 2 hrs later he's at home not answering texts or calls and he hasn't sent me anything.m!! What the fuck!!!
[2016-08-15, 9:42:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe he freaked out man.. Stress?
[2016-08-15, 9:42:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Embarrassed m
[2016-08-15, 9:43:50 PM] Jamie: Is he 15? This is a 30 year old adult with a mortgage, a wife and a dog.
[2016-08-15, 11:13:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry man been crazy busy at a Taiwanese trade dinner
[2016-08-15, 11:14:13 PM] Jamie: All good. Just writing up Sean's termination letter
[2016-08-15, 11:56:58 PM] Jamie: What a shitty fucking day. It was supposed to be a great day, 2 vans secured after more than 3 weeks of work. And in the same day I lose one of the van drivers. It's a giant cosmic joke
[2016-08-15, 11:58:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow. That choked about it, eh? Will that leave you strapped for guys?
[2016-08-16, 12:00:25 AM] Jamie: Totally. But once someone ignores their boss like this, it's over whether I want it or not. And then it just shows the other guys they don't have to take me seriously.
[2016-08-16, 12:01:28 AM] Jamie: If he decides not to show up tomorrow in my truck (Shayne is supposed to get a ride in with him but Sean hasn't responded), I will have to call the police and see what my options are.
[2016-08-16, 12:02:41 AM] Rob Feeny: So the truck is still drivable then? If he took it home...
[2016-08-16, 12:03:50 AM] Jamie: Yes. There are pictures on the photostream. I logged into the team account. Front bumper, hood, headlight, passenger quarter panel.
[2016-08-16, 12:05:04 AM] Jamie: Either way, I won't ever be able to respect him or trust him again after this. If this was client property and he handled it this poorly?
[2016-08-16, 12:06:03 AM] Jamie: It's going to be impossible to sleep with this hanging over me. Fuck
[2016-08-16, 12:11:51 AM] Rob Feeny: I could give you a sleeping pill if it would help. Would probably knock you right out.
[2016-08-16, 12:12:07 AM] Rob Feeny: It fucking sucks man. I wish there was some way I could help. Pretty shitty behavior on his part.
[2016-08-16, 12:15:08 AM] Jamie: I have too much to do to risk sleeping in. I need to be at Starbucks at 5:30 to post ads and look at craigslist for new employees. I have a full day of onsite programming but now I need to leave to go to a meeting he was supposed to handle. I can't depend on anyone. Whenever I count on someone and hand over responsibility I get fucked over eventually
[2016-08-16, 12:16:44 AM] Jamie: And I have to figure out what to do with the vans. Now that Shayne has to drive his truck in we can't even get one van to Shaynes house.
[2016-08-16, 12:17:00 AM] Jamie: FUUUUUUUUUUUCK
[2016-08-16, 9:28:52 AM] Rob Feeny: How are you doing Jamie?
[2016-08-16, 9:51:34 AM] Jamie: I got about three hours asleep woke up in a pool of sweat
[2016-08-16, 9:54:11 AM] Jamie: Got a second?
[2016-08-16, 9:54:49 AM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2016-08-16, 4:55:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I think I was going to quit the Zenon Energy consulting job. I'm getting nothing out of it buy stress and unpaid work.
[2016-08-16, 5:28:50 PM] Jamie: Makes sense. Any upside?
[2016-08-16, 5:32:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Less stress and work?
[2016-08-16, 5:32:59 PM] Rob Feeny: But it looked good on my LinkedIn
[2016-08-16, 5:33:14 PM] Rob Feeny: But I'm doing too much and I'm not happy
[2016-08-16, 5:33:21 PM] Jamie: Haha that pretty much sells itself. Any hot chicks or cool events?
[2016-08-16, 5:34:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope. Nick is never around so I'm not learning anything and he doesn't want to invest in the business at all. I'm just not comfortable selling the consulting.
[2016-08-16, 5:35:20 PM] Jamie: Yeah if you don't believe in it, hard to sell
[2016-08-16, 5:36:29 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm struggling lately, always feel like I'm letting people down. Hard not to run away and live in the woods
[2016-08-16, 5:36:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Wanna join? Haha
[2016-08-16, 5:37:15 PM] Jamie: Totally. And that's a frustrating feeling for sure
[2016-08-16, 5:39:08 PM] Rob Feeny: How are you faring?
[2016-08-16, 5:40:52 PM] Jamie: I'm ok. There are 2 resumes I got that look promising so I am setting up meetings with them
[2016-08-16, 11:30:59 PM] Jamie: Day still going?
[2016-08-16, 11:31:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Just got home. You?
[2016-08-16, 11:36:56 PM] Jamie: Went sailing with Dan.  Then dinner now home
[2016-08-16, 11:40:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice. Did that help some?
[2016-08-16, 11:48:38 PM] Jamie: Yeah
[2016-08-17, 10:20:31 AM] Jamie: I just talk to Sean 23 minutes ago and when I called him to ask him something he hasn't answered his phone or's text in 20 minutes
[2016-08-17, 10:21:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Is he driving?
[2016-08-17, 10:21:47 AM] Rob Feeny: That man has a serious phone problem
[2016-08-17, 10:22:32 AM] Jamie: Shayne and Shawn are carpooling. I can't get a hold of Shayne either
[2016-08-17, 10:24:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Fucking hell
[2016-08-17, 10:32:26 AM] Jamie: Do you have a quick second to answer question
[2016-08-17, 10:32:59 AM] Rob Feeny: On toilet give me 2min
[2016-08-17, 11:16:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Just sent the email to quit Zenon Energy
[2016-08-17, 11:17:15 AM] Jamie: That probably feels good
[2016-08-17, 11:17:31 AM] Rob Feeny: Good and bad
[2016-08-17, 11:17:46 AM] Rob Feeny: I feel like I ran away from work
[2016-08-17, 11:18:33 AM] Jamie: Unpaid work. It's very hard to walk away from potential. But potential doesn't pay and you have enough talent to get paid
[2016-08-17, 11:22:08 AM] Rob Feeny: It's the knowing "if I were more disciplined I would have been able to make something of it"
[2016-08-17, 11:22:59 AM] Jamie: It's the best you can do in the situation at this time. It's all you can expect of yourself
[2016-08-17, 11:37:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Well he was super cool about it
[2016-08-17, 11:38:24 AM] Jamie: I bet that's a relief?
[2016-08-17, 11:39:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup. We both left open and the opportunity for me to help him with Consulting projects for pay
[2016-08-17, 11:46:03 AM] Jamie: Cool man
[2016-08-17, 11:46:08 AM] Jamie: A weight off your shoulders
[2016-08-17, 1:58:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey have you talked to Kris about the panels?
[2016-08-17, 2:01:00 PM] Jamie: Yes he would rather wait. Do we know if we can generate power before occupation?
[2016-08-17, 2:01:13 PM] Jamie: And I am trying to get them to pay for it all and we can store
[2016-08-17, 2:03:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a reply from Ian this morning and he doesn't know. Said to call 311. I can do that this afternoon
[2016-08-17, 2:06:07 PM] Jamie: Might ask to speak to the electrical inspector about it
[2016-08-17, 2:06:50 PM] Rob Feeny: That was my plan
[2016-08-17, 2:07:09 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm terminating a bunch of wire so I'll throw it on speaker
[2016-08-17, 2:07:22 PM] Jamie: Cool thanks.
[2016-08-17, 4:21:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Free Friday am?
[2016-08-17, 4:24:32 PM] Jamie: I think i have to drive to surrey to pull a permit
[2016-08-17, 4:34:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I am meeting with Brad for the solar proposal, on site. No worries.
[2016-08-17, 4:34:50 PM] Jamie: I can probably make it and then go to surrey
[2016-08-17, 4:37:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Invite sent.
[2016-08-17, 10:57:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I think I need to bring in a pro on this proposal. I think I'll see what I can work out with Mark to be very involved in it. It's damn complicated.
[2016-08-17, 10:57:25 PM] Jamie: Why what's up?
‎[2016-08-17, 10:57:40 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-17, 10:58:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm just working through it and not sure about lots of things and don't want to let Brad down
[2016-08-17, 10:58:27 PM] Jamie: Doing better than him!
[2016-08-17, 10:59:13 PM] Rob Feeny: What do you mean?
[2016-08-17, 11:00:06 PM] Jamie: Well Brad wouldn't know where to start. So we have progressed it more than he could have. At least you know some people to ask
[2016-08-17, 11:01:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok ok. I'm just nervous about asking and pissing people off. And Craig, the guy I was hoping to use, declined the opportunity, too busy
[2016-08-17, 11:01:37 PM] Jamie: You should talk to solar equipment sales guys. They generally know enough to sell the product and lots of times that means doing the design themselves
[2016-08-17, 11:01:40 PM] Rob Feeny: 60 panels can fit BTW
[2016-08-17, 11:02:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes I was thinking about that. I was planning on calling HES tomorrow but that's Mark's supplier and I know he'll hear about it
[2016-08-17, 11:02:23 PM] Jamie: Holy crap. And just tell Brad that the guy declined and you will try to find someone else.
[2016-08-18, 1:32:49 PM] Jamie: I reserved 2 beach camp sites at this place. We can cancel up to 7 days before for free. What do you think?
[2016-08-18, 1:32:54 PM] Jamie: https://www.wyapoint.com
[2016-08-18, 1:36:29 PM] Rob Feeny: It's pretty far crop Tofino and looks pricey but it looks damn nice
[2016-08-18, 1:37:28 PM] Jamie: I did just a quick search and two sites came up. One of them is completely booked for a wedding and they suggested this one because it's right on the beach. I reserved it just in case we get booked out of anything else before we get to it
[2016-08-18, 1:37:42 PM] Jamie: I will look more tonight
[2016-08-18, 1:38:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sorry I've been too busy to do it
[2016-08-18, 1:38:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Sue is in for sure just invited Sam
[2016-08-18, 1:38:20 PM] Jamie: I saw that
[2016-08-18, 2:07:44 PM] Rob Feeny: I put a post on FB just in case but I bet the site will be great
[2016-08-18, 3:46:35 PM] Rob Feeny: No luck getting a hold of a city inspector to ask about the interconnection before occupancy question
[2016-08-18, 3:46:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Left another message
[2016-08-18, 3:49:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Have you talked to Rob Baxter lately? I am going to email asking him and saying that's the only holdup, see what he knows and let him know we haven't forgotten him
[2016-08-18, 3:52:27 PM] Jamie: Ok and no I haven't talked to him lately
[2016-08-18, 3:56:01 PM] Rob Feeny: On it. David called me as I was writing it
[2016-08-18, 4:02:15 PM] Jamie: Can't talk for an hot
[2016-08-18, 4:02:17 PM] Jamie: Hour
[2016-08-18, 4:02:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Cool
[2016-08-18, 7:31:13 PM] Rob Feeny: How was the golf tournament?
[2016-08-18, 7:32:03 PM] Jamie: Still playing
[2016-08-18, 7:33:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok have fun
[2016-08-18, 9:32:44 PM] Jamie: Hmmm Bella Pacifica doesn't look like its on the beach
[2016-08-18, 9:33:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahh ok. And I saw the family focust
[2016-08-18, 9:33:20 PM] Jamie: Same with the one I booked actually
[2016-08-18, 9:35:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Didn't the one you booked say it was on a private beach?
[2016-08-18, 9:36:14 PM] Jamie: Yup. Actually so is Bella Pacifica now that I dig deeper. There is a surf shop onsite the one I booked. I will call Bella Pacifica tomorrow
[2016-08-18, 9:37:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok no worries. What's the price like?
[2016-08-18, 9:37:56 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm fine with the one you booked honestly. I'd prefer to focus on the surf part
[2016-08-18, 9:38:48 PM] Jamie: $40 a night for 2 4 man tents per site or the equivalent. Didn't seem like it has a per person charge. 1 vehicle per campsite or $10 each for extra
[2016-08-18, 9:39:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha cheeeeap
[2016-08-18, 9:39:22 PM] Jamie: Me too. Depends if we want to go into Tofino to party. I would rather buy food and camp
[2016-08-18, 9:39:28 PM] Jamie: Yeah I know
[2016-08-18, 11:22:14 PM] Jamie: Very excited about Tofino. Even if everyone bails and it's just you and I, it will be great
[2016-08-18, 11:22:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I am looking forward to it too. Want to take my car to save on gas?
[2016-08-18, 11:23:06 PM] Jamie: With all the gear?
[2016-08-18, 11:23:16 PM] Jamie: I'm game. Not driving = awesome
[2016-08-18, 11:24:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha we'll see how much stuff we have / how many people. Or would you reclaim your truck? I thought you'd take the fiat
[2016-08-18, 11:24:44 PM] Jamie: I should have my truck back in a week
[2016-08-18, 11:24:57 PM] Jamie: Good bye fiat
[2016-08-18, 11:25:16 PM] Jamie: I like the small car but not that one
[2016-08-18, 11:27:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yeah I forgot that you already have two vans so you don't have to give your truck to Shane Anymore
[2016-08-18, 11:27:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Will it be repaired yet?
[2016-08-18, 11:29:02 PM] Jamie: Called yesterday about something so they are working on it. I'm actually happy to have it back
[2016-08-18, 11:30:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey tomorrow morning we should talk on the phone early because we need to sort out getting that solar equipment from vrec
[2016-08-18, 11:30:58 PM] Jamie: Confirmed its all there?
[2016-08-18, 11:31:25 PM] Jamie: He said he was missing racking
[2016-08-18, 11:32:22 PM] Rob Feeny: They have all the things but I believe they are in various locations. He was waiting to hear from Rob if they were going to deliver it all or we were picking it up. So David was asking about where to stage it et cetera
[2016-08-18, 11:34:00 PM] Jamie: My storage locker will let couriers drop it in the locker and then will relock it. But it's pretty full right now. By mid next week all the stuff will be back in the vans.
[2016-08-18, 11:34:46 PM] Jamie: So I don't mind storing it but I need until then to clear the space and try to get it paid for. That work?
[2016-08-18, 11:35:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha he's pushing for ASAP, can we try for Tuesday?
[2016-08-18, 11:36:35 PM] Jamie: Monday all guys are booked. Tuesday we load the van. Might be able to jam it all into that day. I will know more tomorrow.
[2016-08-18, 11:37:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I'll push back as much as I can.
[2016-08-18, 11:38:28 PM] Jamie: Haha just don't answer. We chased him. Make him chase us 😏
[2016-08-18, 11:38:37 PM] Jamie: Diabolical!
[2016-08-18, 11:38:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahah yah but this is David, he's been good and he's a nice guy
[2016-08-18, 11:40:53 PM] Jamie: I will look closer tomorrow.
[2016-08-18, 11:42:47 PM] Rob Feeny: np
[2016-08-19, 2:24:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey do you suppose I could use your helmet this weekend to take a girl for a ride?
[2016-08-19, 2:46:55 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-08-19, 3:15:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ferries at 12:50 and 3:10 from horseshoe Bay in mid September
‎[2016-08-19, 3:15:37 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-19, 3:43:33 PM] Jamie: 12:50 then. Cool
[2016-08-20, 9:47:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey just hitting the liquor store and Safeway do you need anything?
[2016-08-20, 9:47:54 PM] Jamie: Nope. I'm doing exactly the same thing
[2016-08-20, 9:48:01 PM] Jamie: I really don't want to go
[2016-08-20, 9:49:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah? Tired?
[2016-08-20, 9:50:10 PM] Jamie: Yeah that. And just pretty close to done with people for today.
[2016-08-20, 9:50:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yah? What's up?
[2016-08-20, 9:53:08 PM] Jamie: I bumped into Cassidy at the coffee shop and she was just such a bitch. Makes no sense. We went out to lunch the week before last and had a great time, no drama.
[2016-08-20, 9:53:43 PM] Rob Feeny: She's crazy, man..
[2016-08-20, 9:53:46 PM] Jamie: I truthfully never want to see her again.
[2016-08-20, 9:53:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Bipolar?
[2016-08-20, 9:54:08 PM] Jamie: And incredibly self absorbed.
[2016-08-20, 9:55:09 PM] Rob Feeny: And immature?
[2016-08-20, 9:55:48 PM] Jamie: All of those. But all of the ones I'm attracted to are
[2016-08-20, 9:56:37 PM] Rob Feeny: You've got some need to care for, protect girls? Ha so. Do I..
[2016-08-20, 9:56:39 PM] Jamie: It has to do with Sean too. I'm just so tired of people sucking my life energy and not giving back
[2016-08-20, 9:57:47 PM] Jamie: I want to close myself out and strip my life bare of these types of people. But then I realized I might be one of these types so the people I want to hang around with avoid me
[2016-08-20, 9:58:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Or you somehow attract people that are like that, like Morgan attracts people that rely on him?
[2016-08-20, 9:58:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I've thought about that myself.
[2016-08-20, 9:59:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn Safeway is stripped of premarinated stuff
[2016-08-20, 9:59:23 PM] Jamie: And they are too polite or chicken to say anything so they are just vague about why they don't respond or ignore things
[2016-08-20, 9:59:47 PM] Jamie: Leaves me doing circles and thinking this all women are fucking selfish bitches
[2016-08-20, 10:00:08 PM] Jamie: I'm at the other Safeway. What are you looking for?
[2016-08-20, 10:00:15 PM] Rob Feeny: No, they're not but maybe a drastic change is needed in how you meet them?
[2016-08-20, 10:00:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Anything. Steak or pork, not too big
[2016-08-20, 10:00:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe steak for a change splurge haha

[2016-08-20, 10:02:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man
[2016-08-20, 10:03:14 PM] Jamie: I beginning to think women can't handle meeting guys not online
[2016-08-20, 10:03:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Or not in bars...
[2016-08-20, 10:04:03 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't like to be an aggressive guy but I have wondered at times if the ones you can meet passively are a certain type
[2016-08-20, 10:05:31 PM] Jamie: Yep that's probably true. I also think we give women too much respect
[2016-08-20, 10:05:36 PM] Jamie: Puts a lot of pressure on them
[2016-08-21, 1:13:02 PM] Jamie: Hit the pool today for a quick dip?
[2016-08-21, 1:13:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm in full Reno mode, pretty busy day
[2016-08-21, 1:13:59 PM] Jamie: Ok no worries
[2016-08-21, 7:22:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Still working lol. Not going to have BBQing time
[2016-08-21, 7:22:49 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2016-08-21, 7:22:51 PM] Rob Feeny: And I am supposed to take some girl riding and I've already bailed on her once
[2016-08-21, 7:25:04 PM] Rob Feeny: But hey my room is looking great lol
[2016-08-21, 7:25:29 PM] Jamie: Awesome
[2016-08-21, 9:36:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn all the paint out in the shed is toast
[2016-08-21, 9:37:24 PM] Jamie: Shitty. Is there some in the storage room inside?
[2016-08-21, 9:37:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I'm blending them to make sufficient paint haha
[2016-08-21, 10:43:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh and I know I still owe you for that steak! I forgot to give you cash last night, sorry
[2016-08-22, 3:16:41 PM] Rob Feeny: How's the storage situation? Got David breathing down my neck
[2016-08-22, 3:20:40 PM] Jamie: I haven't been paid for it yet and I don't have the $8000. So while there will be room in my locker soon, I'm sure they want payment first.
[2016-08-22, 3:25:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. He'll just have to wait
[2016-08-22, 3:25:49 PM] Jamie: I am frustrated that this is being pushed so hard. Not at you
[2016-08-22, 3:26:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha maybe they need the money
[2016-08-22, 7:45:47 PM] Jamie: Hey I have some chicken in the freezer from some I bought from Costco that I don't like because it is too stringy. Probably good for wraps / stirfrys. You want?
[2016-08-22, 7:54:54 PM] Rob Feeny: For sure
[2016-08-22, 7:54:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha
[2016-08-22, 7:55:02 PM] Rob Feeny: No waste!
[2016-08-22, 7:55:54 PM] Jamie: I figured.
[2016-08-22, 7:58:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Still working on that damn room if you can believe it. Just leaving home Depot.
[2016-08-22, 8:14:36 PM] Jamie: Crazy
‎[2016-08-22, 8:25:04 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-22, 8:26:29 PM] Jamie: Wow! Way better
[2016-08-22, 8:30:34 PM] Jamie: The two tone is great
[2016-08-22, 8:30:50 PM] Jamie: A little bit like blue sky
[2016-08-22, 8:30:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks, it's really changed the tone
[2016-08-22, 8:31:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah that was my intention.. But the first time the blue was wayyyyy too blue
[2016-08-23, 11:28:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Are you mad at me for something then? Ever since last week you've been weird.
[2016-08-23, 11:30:06 AM] Jamie: It's just a tough position. I know you want to keep your relationship with David good but that seems to mean hammering on me to keep him happy.
[2016-08-23, 11:32:44 AM] Rob Feeny: No, you just didn't ever make it clear to me that the hold up was you getting money from the client. Originally you had ME hammering on HIM to get everything together promptly and then all of a sudden it was hurry up and wait...
[2016-08-23, 11:32:57 AM] Jamie: I asked them to get all the stuff ready with the expectation it would take them a while. I invoiced the client but have not been paid. I owe VREC nothing. They have been a pain. I normally would not feel any pressure to operate on their timetable now but because you are involved I do. I feel sort of stuck in the middle
[2016-08-23, 11:33:04 AM] Rob Feeny: What I've been hearing has changed several times and so I am confused and feeling foolish
[2016-08-23, 11:34:09 AM] Rob Feeny: And it actually worries me that that, which is work stuff, it has affected our relationship as friends and brothers as opposed to being kept outside of it
[2016-08-23, 11:39:27 AM] Jamie: Sorry man. I have been under an enormous amount of pressure in the last couple weeks. I also feel torn between my loyalty to you and how I would normally handle someone like VREC
[2016-08-23, 11:41:32 AM] Rob Feeny: I can totally understand that man. Just don't forget that I am still your brother and you don't need to be awkward around me. It was probably uncomfortable for you this morning when it shouldn't have been.
[2016-08-24, 12:33:25 PM] Rob Feeny: How are you doing today?
[2016-08-24, 12:33:56 PM] Jamie: I'm pretty good. Getting things back under control. You?
[2016-08-24, 12:39:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha stayed up almost all night again but actually doing quite well. Been a productive 2 weeks
[2016-08-24, 12:42:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Won't make it to running tho. So tired.
[2016-08-24, 12:43:24 PM] Jamie: I bet. Any paid work?
[2016-08-24, 12:49:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah lots. Was at WCO until 7 last night, back working for Morgan at 7:30am.
[2016-08-24, 12:49:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Took 2 hours to go over everything for Brad's solar job too. Just waiting to see if they go for it. Learning lots.
[2016-08-24, 12:49:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Beer after running? Or will you be wiped?
[2016-08-24, 12:51:52 PM] Jamie: I'm game for a beer but might not work after running. I will be tired and hungry. I will have to see
[2016-08-24, 10:29:21 PM] Jamie: I'm wiped. And I feel like a teenager again, my acne is so bad :(
[2016-08-24, 10:32:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm must be the stress
[2016-08-24, 10:32:30 PM] Jamie: I think so. And the sweat while sleeping
[2016-08-24, 10:32:47 PM] Jamie: I need a nightly face wash I think. What do you use?
‎[2016-08-24, 10:35:05 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-24, 10:35:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Finishing your shower with cooler water helps too
[2016-08-24, 10:37:49 PM] Jamie: You use it in the shower?
[2016-08-24, 10:38:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes
[2016-08-24, 10:38:07 PM] Jamie: Ok thanks
[2016-08-24, 10:38:13 PM] Jamie: Still awake, huh?
[2016-08-24, 10:44:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Just cleaning the floor. I took a nap for an hour. One coat left on the baseboards
[2016-08-24, 10:45:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Not bothering to paint the door. Man I'm sick of painting
[2016-08-24, 10:45:44 PM] Jamie: I bet. When I did my place, by the end I was slapping it on
[2016-08-24, 10:46:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Yahhhhh standards have gone down
[2016-08-24, 10:46:11 PM] Rob Feeny: It's my most hated renovation task
[2016-08-24, 10:46:25 PM] Rob Feeny: But I need to get my stuff out of Genny's room and clean it
[2016-08-24, 10:46:37 PM] Jamie: When does she arrive?
[2016-08-24, 10:47:02 PM] Rob Feeny: She showed up 2 days ago then left right away to see family on the island. Only dropped a suitcase
[2016-08-24, 10:47:25 PM] Jamie: Cute?
[2016-08-24, 10:50:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Not bad. Maybe Jane level.
[2016-08-24, 10:50:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Not my style but seems coom
[2016-08-24, 10:55:27 PM] Jamie: Nice. There was a cute Asian girl at intervals. Volleyball player.  Didn't come for coffee but hopefully she comes back next week.
[2016-08-24, 10:56:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice!
[2016-08-24, 10:56:27 PM] Rob Feeny: We're still doing pretty well got Tofino.. M
[2016-08-24, 10:57:24 PM] Jamie: Yes. This guy Josh Evans is pretty cool, he's going to come too
[2016-08-24, 10:57:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok is he from running?
[2016-08-24, 10:58:24 PM] Jamie: Yup. Been to intervals 6 or 7 times.  Faster than me that's for sure
[2016-08-25, 11:24:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey just thought of it. There's a product for your face that is basically wet naps for cleaning your face before bed. I don't buy it because it's expensive but I bet it would be easier for you
[2016-08-25, 11:37:47 AM] Jamie: I love it. What's it called?
[2016-08-25, 11:38:12 AM] Rob Feeny: I don't recall, there are several brands but anywhere like shoppers would have them.
[2016-08-25, 1:10:38 PM] Jamie: Very frustrating that there's no way to set a low power mode on your Mac. Sitting in the coffee shop on Broadway my battery lasts less than an hour and 45 minutes
[2016-08-25, 1:11:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. An app to kill processes?
[2016-08-25, 1:11:29 PM] Jamie: I guess that's what it'll have to be.
[2016-08-25, 1:17:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe it's time to replace the battery?
[2016-08-25, 1:17:47 PM] Jamie: I think the battery is fine. I think that's the operating system has so many features running in the background that it's just draining the battery quickly. I don't seem to have any way of controlling that
[2016-08-25, 1:18:11 PM] Jamie: All of the iCloud updating and future sinking and stuff like that kills the battery
[2016-08-25, 1:18:23 PM] Jamie: The newest MacBooks will have a bigger battery I bet to make up for the fact that the OS is draining it
[2016-08-25, 1:22:38 PM] Rob Feeny: And of course airplane mode isn't an option
[2016-08-25, 1:23:02 PM] Jamie: That's the weird part. The iPhone has airplane mode or even a little power mode. But the computers have nothing
[2016-08-25, 1:23:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Because nothing works without the internet now
[2016-08-25, 1:23:16 PM] Jamie: Low power*
[2016-08-25, 1:23:34 PM] Jamie: I think shutting off the Wi-Fi actually burns more power because of all those processes trying and failing to get to the Internet
[2016-08-25, 1:23:46 PM] Jamie: Who knows? I will just buy a new computer, ha ha
[2016-08-25, 1:28:11 PM] Rob Feeny: And so the cycle continues haha
[2016-08-25, 1:28:24 PM] Jamie: Right?
[2016-08-25, 1:29:36 PM] Rob Feeny: 🎼 The ciiiiiircle of Maaaaac 🎤
[2016-08-25, 6:37:38 PM] Jamie: Seems like all the wet nap style ones are makeup removers
[2016-08-25, 6:38:08 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm really? I know Graciela had some but they were pretty expensive.
[2016-08-25, 6:38:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I thought I saw some Neutrogena ones
‎[2016-08-25, 6:38:39 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-25, 6:39:08 PM] Jamie: Do you use a scrubber or your hands to apply the other kind?
[2016-08-25, 6:39:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I use my hands
[2016-08-25, 6:40:03 PM] Rob Feeny: And honestly makeup remover wipes could work just fine for you. They would just be removing oil and grease and dirt instead
[2016-08-25, 6:40:31 PM] Jamie: Haha lots of waste though. I blame you for that
[2016-08-25, 6:40:37 PM] Jamie: I will try the same as you
[2016-08-25, 6:41:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah they need to make them biodegradable then you could just throw them in the compost
[2016-08-25, 6:41:17 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-08-25, 6:42:15 PM] Rob Feeny: http://www.iherb.com/Derma-E-Hydrating-Facial-Wipes-25-Pre-Moistened-Compostable-Wipes/56967
[2016-08-25, 6:42:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Actually it looks like there are lots of options in that department. Maybe I should buy some of the less-expensive ones of the internet for myself
[2016-08-25, 6:42:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Because the problem is that I don't wash my face and not because it's a pain before bed and I am tired
[2016-08-25, 6:44:16 PM] Jamie: Yeah I was thinking about that. But I treat my face with acne medicine every night so I think this is just as good
[2016-08-25, 7:52:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Is there any time that's bad for you or good for you tomorrow for Rob Baxter to drop off the panels? I'm just replying to this email.
[2016-08-25, 8:45:57 PM] Jamie: Any time
[2016-08-25, 11:07:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I think if you had to take part in the BC sustainable energy Association meetings you might actually kill someone
[2016-08-25, 11:07:43 PM] Rob Feeny: We do so much talking and so little actual doing
[2016-08-25, 11:07:53 PM] Rob Feeny: And then there's that one girl that always just has to be negative and shoot down everything
[2016-08-25, 11:09:03 PM] Jamie: You are probably right. I wish I had more patience sometimes though. Might be entertaining if I could not care
[2016-08-25, 11:09:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh it's not just you that doesn't have patience we were all ready to kill her
[2016-08-25, 11:09:35 PM] Rob Feeny: It took 2 hours to go through one document that we had 30 minutes for
[2016-08-25, 11:10:05 PM] Rob Feeny: We could have used someone like you because you probably would have had the guts to tell her to shut up
[2016-08-25, 11:10:39 PM] Rob Feeny: We had a live document going for feedback on the new chapter guidelines and she wrote a serious page-and-a-half on how they were seeking the wrong type of Engagement that was top down instead of interpretive
[2016-08-25, 11:10:58 PM] Jamie: Oh god
[2016-08-25, 11:11:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Her feedback was actually longer than the document she was given feedback on
[2016-08-25, 11:11:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry I'm venting as I walk over to another place to have a beer with Scott stanners
[2016-08-25, 11:12:19 PM] Jamie: Well if someone could harness her enthusiasm haha.
[2016-08-25, 11:13:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes she is an office manager I think she is paid to look for every little thing that could go wrong.
[2016-08-25, 11:13:12 PM] Rob Feeny: But man it's exhausting being around her
[2016-08-26, 10:31:04 AM] Jamie: Nothing back from Rob Baxter hey?
[2016-08-26, 11:08:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Not since I replied last evening. You were CC'd on it
[2016-08-26, 12:33:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Just got a 15min heads up on delivery
[2016-08-26, 12:34:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Real organized.
[2016-08-26, 12:34:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Says there will be 2 deliveries, so I said the storage place would accept them
[2016-08-26, 12:34:30 PM] Rob Feeny: He'll call me if there are any issues
[2016-08-26, 12:35:01 PM] Jamie: If he jams my locker full so I can't get in, I will go thermonuclear on him, just saying
[2016-08-26, 12:35:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha
[2016-08-26, 12:35:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Nobody nearby? I would take 40min to make it there
[2016-08-26, 12:35:53 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm sure it will be fine
[2016-08-26, 12:36:17 PM] Jamie: I was planning on taking a cab down there to grab my truck at the same time.
[2016-08-26, 12:36:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh damn
[2016-08-26, 12:36:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Want his number m
[2016-08-26, 12:36:51 PM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2016-08-26, 12:37:50 PM] Jamie: I think we already know what's going to happen. No point stressing
[2016-08-26, 12:38:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha indeed. Those guys can't organize shit.
[2016-08-26, 12:52:56 PM] Jamie: Flight is booked to San Juan del sur
[2016-08-26, 1:00:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice! So jealous...
[2016-08-26, 1:00:59 PM] Rob Feeny: What was that worth?
[2016-08-26, 1:01:18 PM] Jamie: 77,000 points
[2016-08-26, 1:01:30 PM] Jamie: I have 250,000
[2016-08-26, 1:02:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok well then
[2016-08-26, 1:52:08 PM] Jamie: $1000 to rent a call for a month. $800 to rent a car for 2 days over 2 weeks. Fucked from very different direction
[2016-08-26, 1:53:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy shit! And a shitty car at that...
[2016-08-26, 1:53:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Should have taken mine
[2016-08-26, 5:26:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Not sure if you have checked on it yet but the stuff is delivered

[2016-08-26, 5:28:23 PM] Jamie: Cool. I was there earlier but they had delivered the panels yet
[2016-08-26, 6:27:17 PM] Jamie: What are you doing?
[2016-08-26, 6:28:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Just driving back from work I'm in Vancouver West
[2016-08-26, 6:29:22 PM] Jamie: Hmmm I'm tempted to go for a dip in the pool at New Brighton. It's hot!
[2016-08-26, 6:30:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah it'd be a dream but I'm at least 45min from home
[2016-08-26, 6:30:52 PM] Jamie: No swim trunk in your handy dandy backpack?
[2016-08-26, 6:31:18 PM] Rob Feeny: No, because I'm taking the work van home! Someone gave me a free desk and nightstand today
[2016-08-26, 6:31:28 PM] Jamie: Oh nice
[2016-08-26, 6:31:51 PM] Rob Feeny: It was actually perfect because I was going to buy white stuff for my room and both of them are white
[2016-08-26, 6:32:09 PM] Jamie: Perfect
[2016-08-26, 6:34:06 PM] Rob Feeny: What are you getting up to tonight?
[2016-08-26, 6:34:53 PM] Jamie: No plans. I don't think I have a beer all week so it will involve some of that
[2016-08-26, 6:36:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay. The German girl Deb is celebrating her birthday tonight but I'm still trying to figure out what's going to happen.
[2016-08-26, 7:25:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I should be home in 10 minutes. Still want to go to the pool?
[2016-08-26, 7:26:58 PM] Jamie: I'm napping on the couch now, haha
[2016-08-26, 7:27:22 PM] Rob Feeny: haha because I was going to say if not I'm taking a nap
[2016-08-26, 8:38:50 PM] Jamie: Gonna take a shower and head to cotto for a beer. I'm buying if you show up
[2016-08-26, 8:39:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. 40min? I'm going to take a 20min nap. Just got all the furniture unloaded.
[2016-08-26, 8:47:06 PM] Jamie: Sure. See ya then
[2016-08-26, 9:27:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugh. Crashed so hard. Walking now.
[2016-08-26, 9:27:38 PM] Jamie: Cool see ya soon
[2016-08-26, 9:34:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Man I forget how long a walk it is
[2016-08-26, 9:34:30 PM] Jamie: Haha step it up stumpy
[2016-08-26, 9:36:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh come on it would be even longer with your short little legs
[2016-08-26, 9:36:53 PM] Jamie: It all comes down to wind resistance.
[2016-08-26, 9:37:00 PM] Rob Feeny: I feel like I'm that walking do in the Olympics
[2016-08-26, 9:37:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Dude
[2016-08-26, 9:37:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh you mean you have less wind resistance because you're so short?
[2016-08-26, 9:38:17 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm so glad I brought a road pop for the walk
[2016-08-26, 9:38:48 PM] Jamie: Exactly!
[2016-08-27, 12:57:35 PM] Jamie: You wanna buy Melissa a $100 diaper pail? Haha
[2016-08-27, 12:58:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, no, but if there are no other options....
[2016-08-27, 12:58:20 PM] Jamie: Oh there is tons of stupid shit for $20
[2016-08-27, 12:58:33 PM] Jamie: Baby Epstein sensory ball
[2016-08-27, 12:58:40 PM] Jamie: Whatever that is.
[2016-08-27, 12:58:46 PM] Jamie: Sounds like a sex toy
[2016-08-27, 12:58:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Einstein?
[2016-08-27, 12:59:06 PM] Jamie: Yeah
[2016-08-27, 12:59:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Can we just buy them booze and be done with it? lol
[2016-08-27, 1:01:11 PM] Jamie: Morgan would be fine with it. Think Janice will come?
[2016-08-27, 1:01:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm not sure
[2016-08-27, 1:01:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Dan mentioned coming
[2016-08-27, 1:01:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to split something more expensive?
[2016-08-27, 1:01:53 PM] Jamie: Maybe. I will see when I set to toys r us
[2016-08-27, 2:03:18 PM] Jamie: You bought them a stuffed dog
[2016-08-27, 2:03:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome thanks man
[2016-08-27, 2:05:35 PM] Jamie: They don't offer wrapping do you think you can bring what we need?
[2016-08-27, 2:06:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I can probably get a dollar store on the way
[2016-08-27, 2:06:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Hit the dollar store
[2016-08-27, 2:06:30 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm just on my way to take the van back to Fairmont and get my car
[2016-08-27, 2:06:33 PM] Jamie: Ok sound good
[2016-08-27, 2:06:50 PM] Jamie: Nobody in the mall will wrap it. What the heck?
[2016-08-27, 2:07:14 PM] Rob Feeny: How big are the items?
[2016-08-27, 2:07:48 PM] Jamie: One is a small stuffed puppy and the other one is about 18" x 6" x 3"
[2016-08-27, 2:09:02 PM] Jamie: That's what I got it figured.
[2016-08-27, 2:09:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay so I figured one rule should be fine.
[2016-08-27, 2:09:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Roll
[2016-08-27, 2:09:57 PM] Jamie: They will wrap it at customer service
[2016-08-27, 2:10:03 PM] Rob Feeny: What do you suppose the etiquette is on drinks? Should I grab a bottle of something?
[2016-08-27, 2:10:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay awesome!
[2016-08-27, 2:10:34 PM] Jamie: I have no idea. I was just going to bring beer
[2016-08-27, 3:23:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Fucking hell everything is so complicated to do downtown
[2016-08-27, 3:23:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I just spent 30 minutes buying a six-pack of beer
[2016-08-27, 3:23:24 PM] Jamie: Yup. Just wait to you try and find parking
[2016-08-27, 3:24:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I figured I should make it there by 2 p.m.
[2016-08-27, 3:24:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I was going to take transit but then Morgan wanted me to bring a bunch of stuff
[2016-08-27, 3:24:51 PM] Jamie: Yeah parking is the worst I've ever seen it for any building anywhere
[2016-08-27, 3:24:58 PM] Jamie: It's part of the reason I never go to his house
‎[2016-08-27, 3:27:34 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-08-27, 3:28:06 PM] Jamie: Wow. Homemade
[2016-08-27, 3:28:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I can see the furnace exhaust and air vent
[2016-08-27, 3:41:36 PM] Jamie: Traffic getting into downtown is brutal
[2016-08-27, 3:42:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Parking is brutal too!
[2016-08-27, 3:42:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm parked three blocks away
[2016-08-27, 3:59:26 PM] Jamie: I'm at the door
[2016-08-28, 12:45:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Man I really hurt my foot and that run yesterday
[2016-08-28, 12:45:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Limping pretty good today
[2016-08-28, 12:51:51 PM] Rob Feeny: How's the race?
[2016-08-28, 12:52:43 PM] Jamie: Just finished. Heading home. How did you hurt your leg?
[2016-08-28, 12:56:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Running Burnaby Mountain.
[2016-08-28, 12:56:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Felt it when it happened, yesterday it was bothering me, today it's hard to walk
[2016-08-28, 12:56:29 PM] Jamie: Twisted ankle?
[2016-08-28, 12:56:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Hurt something in my heel
[2016-08-28, 12:56:33 PM] Jamie: Oh
[2016-08-28, 12:56:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Good people watching?
[2016-08-28, 12:56:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I was sprinting downhill haha
[2016-08-28, 12:57:31 PM] Jamie: That sucks. I'm always worried about tripping
[2016-08-28, 12:57:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. I've considered armour/gloves
[2016-08-28, 2:02:21 PM] Rob Feeny: BTW I'm just waiting on Morgan's pay from the last 2 weeks then I'll send you money for the gifts
[2016-08-28, 2:48:05 PM] Jamie: Was it the pay or Sears that you were buying your T-shirts?
[2016-08-28, 2:48:09 PM] Jamie: Bay*
[2016-08-28, 2:48:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Row bay
[2016-08-28, 2:48:34 PM] Rob Feeny: *The Bay
[2016-08-28, 3:57:52 PM] Jamie: Ha ha there is nothing I need at Costco this bad
[2016-08-28, 3:58:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Chaos? It IS Sunday afternoon at Costco
[2016-08-29, 10:51:29 AM] Rob Feeny: I was going to check on the solar equipment this am on my way to work an realized I forgot the storage key. I'll head back there after work.
[2016-08-29, 10:51:42 AM] Rob Feeny: After I know everything is there I'll call Kris about installing it.
[2016-08-29, 10:52:23 AM] Jamie: Ok sounds good
[2016-08-29, 10:52:32 AM] Jamie: How's your foot?
[2016-08-29, 10:55:58 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm still limping a bit. I tried to find Crocs last night but didn't have any luck haha
[2016-08-29, 10:56:06 AM] Rob Feeny: It made me feel dirty
[2016-08-29, 10:56:16 AM] Jamie: Hahahahahahaha
[2016-08-29, 10:33:38 PM] Rob Feeny: What time does your storage shut down? I'm still working on the place with Genny
[2016-08-29, 10:33:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe I'll go early morning and bring you the jigsaw too
[2016-08-30, 8:34:42 AM] Rob Feeny: When do you leave your house?
[2016-08-30, 8:35:30 AM] Jamie: In about 25 min
[2016-08-30, 8:35:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok headed to Starbucks or off west?
[2016-08-30, 8:36:04 AM] Rob Feeny: I've got the saw by the door and can be ready to head out my door in 15min
[2016-08-30, 8:36:29 AM] Jamie: Off west. Hitting the Starbucks on Willingdon and loughheed after leaving here. Where you headed
[2016-08-30, 8:36:31 AM] Jamie: ?
[2016-08-30, 8:40:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Your storage
[2016-08-30, 8:40:33 AM] Rob Feeny: I can swing by that Starbucks, how about
[2016-08-30, 8:40:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Don't start work with Morgan until 10am
[2016-08-30, 8:41:05 AM] Jamie: Sure. I will be there about 7 and will leave around 7:20
[2016-08-30, 8:41:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Perfect
[2016-08-30, 8:44:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh crap, what the heck, totally thought it was the next weekend. I was talking to someone yesterday who said it was
[2016-08-30, 8:45:32 AM] Rob Feeny: I'd like to go to Kelowna but I think I should stick around here. Maybe go camping or panning, it'll be cheaper
[2016-08-30, 8:45:58 AM] Jamie: Ok. I'm not sure if I will go but the drive would be nice
[2016-08-30, 9:07:45 AM] Jamie: Thank you for bringing me that
[2016-08-30, 9:07:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Np
[2016-08-30, 10:32:07 AM] Rob Feeny: These standoffs in the storage are the originals right? Pretty sure I have only one to Kris
[2016-08-30, 10:32:29 AM] Rob Feeny: But there was a box of lag bolts and washers with them originally.
[2016-08-30, 10:46:03 AM] Jamie: Sorry I meeting
[2016-08-30, 10:46:17 AM] Rob Feeny: np
[2016-08-30, 11:39:01 AM] Rob Feeny: I wonder if their insurance would cover the solar panels?
[2016-08-30, 11:39:36 AM] Rob Feeny: just a random thought
[2016-08-30, 11:39:54 AM] Jamie: Hmm not sure
[2016-08-30, 2:37:41 PM] Jamie: Going to Kelowna with Kat Friday after work
[2016-08-30, 2:46:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay I'm going to stick around here but thanks for the invite
[2016-08-30, 3:00:32 PM] Rob Feeny: So if you ever come over to have a drink at my place, you'll get to have it out of tops glassware. Got a whole boxful haha
[2016-08-30, 3:05:13 PM] Jamie: Nice, haha
[2016-08-30, 9:48:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Did Darren send you a link?
[2016-08-30, 9:52:20 PM] Jamie: Yeah he did. Funny right?
[2016-08-30, 9:55:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah, I lauged out loud!
[2016-08-30, 9:55:53 PM] Rob Feeny: I miss that place

[2016-08-31, 6:44:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Faaaaaaak
[2016-08-31, 6:44:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Fixable you think?
[2016-08-31, 6:49:32 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah
[2016-08-31, 6:50:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Good.
[2016-08-31, 6:50:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Glad to hear it
[2016-08-31, 7:06:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I have so much to do and I don't want to do any of it
[2016-08-31, 8:42:46 PM] Jamie: So come to xsite for free beer and dinner
[2016-08-31, 8:43:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Right away? Or what time?
[2016-08-31, 8:43:19 PM] Jamie: We are here now
[2016-08-31, 8:45:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok gimme a few min, just got out of the shower
[2016-08-31, 8:45:39 PM] Jamie: No worries. We won't order until you get here
[2016-08-31, 8:56:28 PM] Rob Feeny: On. My way
[2016-09-01, 10:18:53 AM] Rob Feeny: I hate when other people's lack of planning becomes my problem

[2016-09-01, 10:19:31 AM] Rob Feeny: That's my exhaust vent hole for my hot water heater
[2016-09-01, 10:32:26 AM] Jamie: Holy crap
[2016-09-01, 10:35:51 AM] Rob Feeny: I skimmed the edge of the trailer brake wires...
[2016-09-01, 10:36:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Good think I blew out the sawdust before pushing my stovepipe through
[2016-09-01, 10:36:47 AM] Jamie: Who needs brakes anyway?
[2016-09-01, 10:51:06 AM] Rob Feeny: I think Ben is going to quit this place so he just wants to finish things as fast as possible
[2016-09-01, 10:52:44 AM] Jamie: So dysfunctional that industry
[2016-09-01, 11:46:07 AM] Rob Feeny: It's the same way for others too though haha. Morgan had me cut a huge hole in the vapor barrier of a house the other day and not do anything about it
[2016-09-01, 11:47:33 AM] Jamie: I see that tons. Specially in retrofits
[2016-09-01, 11:49:31 AM] Jamie: Hey have you ever been on the run to Lake hike up in your big white?
[2016-09-01, 11:49:40 AM] Jamie: Rhonda lake
[2016-09-01, 11:55:13 AM] Rob Feeny: No I haven't
[2016-09-01, 11:55:21 AM] Rob Feeny: That's the one at the base of The Cliff?
[2016-09-01, 1:17:10 PM] Jamie: OK now I'm totally fucking irritated with having to deal with all the stuff all at once. Deal with the claim rental vehicle hiring employee and still invoice at the end of the month. Fuck my life
[2016-09-01, 1:25:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Just take my car man
[2016-09-01, 1:29:38 PM] Jamie: For 2-3 weeks?
[2016-09-01, 1:50:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I think the hassle of me borrowing it back every once in a while will be less than the cost and hassle of a rental
[2016-09-01, 1:50:30 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm not worried
[2016-09-01, 1:57:14 PM] Rob Feeny: If it helps you out, I'm happy to do it
[2016-09-01, 2:15:27 PM] Jamie: Rob I appreciate that. It's hard for me to accept the help but it is $400-600 a week to rent a decent car and I just can't take the $1200 hit right now.
[2016-09-01, 2:25:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Then take it. Buy a few more dinners haha
[2016-09-01, 7:36:23 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm still shaking. The bike is definitely not okay. I think the front forks are bent.
[2016-09-01, 7:36:40 PM] Rob Feeny: It still drives but the handlebars aren't even close to straight
[2016-09-01, 7:46:11 PM] Jamie: Crappy. Do you need my help?
[2016-09-01, 8:16:19 PM] Rob Feeny: No I'm going to take it home I just got off the phone with ICBC and I've got 2% battery
[2016-09-01, 9:18:36 PM] Jamie: Hey man. How's the bike / you?
[2016-09-01, 9:20:48 PM] Rob Feeny: I jammed my left leg pretty good trying to keep from going down
[2016-09-01, 9:20:50 PM] Rob Feeny: It's sore
[2016-09-01, 9:21:15 PM] Rob Feeny: The bike drives, just not straight
[2016-09-01, 9:21:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Gonna take it to a shop tomorrow
[2016-09-01, 9:21:57 PM] Jamie: You need your car to get to work tomorrow?
[2016-09-01, 9:23:05 PM] Rob Feeny: No I'm just doing Super van stuff with Morgan, I'll be fine.
[2016-09-01, 9:23:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet the shop won't even have time for me
[2016-09-01, 9:23:22 PM] Rob Feeny: I can still drive it
[2016-09-01, 9:24:07 PM] Jamie: Ok I can arrange a car for after the weekend if you think you can survive
[2016-09-01, 10:20:50 PM] Rob Feeny: When do you leave for ktown? Tomorrow night? I should probably change the oil in the car but I can do it before I go. It's sitting in the shed.
[2016-09-01, 10:26:59 PM] Jamie: We were planning on leaving around 3.  I don't have time in my day to leave the vehicle with you for the oil change. I will just take it somewhere
[2016-09-01, 10:27:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok don't worry, it'll be fine til you get back
[2016-09-01, 10:28:15 PM] Jamie: Ok that's easier.
[2016-09-01, 11:06:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey it's random but in McDonald's yesterday I saw an obituary for a man with the last name Trithardt, survived by a son (among others) names Chris (different spelling I know).
[2016-09-01, 11:06:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Just thought it might be the same and a heads up might help you out in some way
[2016-09-01, 11:25:53 PM] Jamie: Appreciate that. I talked to him for a while today and he didn't say a word
[2016-09-01, 11:26:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool
[2016-09-02, 10:51:18 AM] Jamie: How's your leg?
[2016-09-02, 10:51:32 AM] Jamie: And what's this box of power cords in the back seat?
[2016-09-02, 10:51:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Sore. Just waiting to see the doc
[2016-09-02, 10:52:01 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahh forgot about that. It's just recycling.
[2016-09-02, 1:38:32 PM] Jamie: What did the doc say?
[2016-09-02, 1:40:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Should be going to get exrays of my hip and heel due to the possibility of small fractures. Going to try to do it this afternoon
[2016-09-02, 1:40:53 PM] Rob Feeny: *Xrays
[2016-09-02, 1:41:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Bike shop thinks they can straighten my front end pretty easily, going to try to fit me in tomorrow afternoon
[2016-09-02, 1:41:45 PM] Jamie: I'm happy to pay for it in exchange for using your car
[2016-09-02, 1:42:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh it'll all be covered by insurance
[2016-09-02, 1:42:13 PM] Rob Feeny: He was 100% at fault
[2016-09-02, 1:42:14 PM] Rob Feeny: But thanks
[2016-09-02, 1:43:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Can get physio too, if my leg is giving me problems. I had trouble shifting the bike today
[2016-09-02, 1:43:59 PM] Rob Feeny: But really I think I'll be fine in a few days
[2016-09-02, 5:23:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh Morgan. He asked me to commit to working every Friday with him on SuperVans but instead I ended up just cleaning the van while he ran errands.
[2016-09-02, 5:25:27 PM] Rob Feeny: So I left
[2016-09-06, 8:39:27 AM] Jamie: Morning. How was your weekend?
[2016-09-06, 8:44:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Good man. Super mellow.
[2016-09-06, 8:44:16 AM] Rob Feeny: How was Kelowna?
[2016-09-06, 8:45:34 AM] Jamie: It was entertaining. Cat and I got super drunk on Saturday at doc willobys. What was I thinking doing shooters?
[2016-09-06, 8:45:54 AM] Jamie: Went to a couple wineries went on a hike… Pretty good
[2016-09-06, 8:45:57 AM] Rob Feeny: Hahah you were thinking "I can still keep up with this 23yr old..."
[2016-09-06, 8:46:48 AM] Jamie: I think it had to do with the wine we drank earlier.  I just remember bumping into people from high school and hugging everybody
[2016-09-06, 8:47:01 AM] Jamie: I don't remember leaving it all
[2016-09-06, 8:47:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha
[2016-09-06, 8:47:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice work
[2016-09-06, 8:48:00 AM] Jamie: I really needed to blow off some steam and that did it
[2016-09-06, 8:48:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Good.
[2016-09-06, 8:48:14 AM] Rob Feeny: How was Mom's?
[2016-09-06, 8:48:30 AM] Jamie: Painful. I sure was glad to have cat there is an insulator
[2016-09-06, 8:49:24 AM] Jamie: Her mobility is not good. She never leaves the house so going to the yacht club for dinner was a huge deal
[2016-09-06, 8:49:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh man
[2016-09-06, 8:49:45 AM] Rob Feeny: She's not getting any exercise?
[2016-09-06, 8:50:04 AM] Jamie: Nope. She sits at her computer all day and never leaves
[2016-09-06, 8:51:25 AM] Jamie: Did you get the X-rays back?
[2016-09-06, 8:52:05 AM] Rob Feeny: No I haven't had a chance to go yet. Goijg this am
[2016-09-06, 8:52:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Heel still hurts
[2016-09-06, 8:53:54 AM] Jamie: Any luck with the bike?
[2016-09-06, 8:54:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah it's all repaired. New handle bars and front end realigned
[2016-09-06, 8:54:58 AM] Jamie: How much?
[2016-09-06, 8:55:16 AM] Rob Feeny: $289
[2016-09-06, 8:55:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Not bad. Just gotta send it to ICBC
[2016-09-06, 8:55:56 AM] Jamie: That's not bad at all. And pretty fast. Got good rain gear?
[2016-09-06, 8:58:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha no, but it doesn't bother me much.
[2016-09-06, 8:58:37 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm not riding any long distances. You can hang onto the car.
[2016-09-06, 8:58:44 AM] Rob Feeny: I also have the Tercel to use
[2016-09-06, 9:07:08 AM] Jamie: Appreciate that. It did well
[2016-09-06, 9:12:58 AM] Rob Feeny: Good little beast eh?
[2016-09-06, 5:31:00 PM] Jamie: What are you doing tonight?
[2016-09-06, 5:31:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Cleaning my place?
[2016-09-06, 5:32:34 PM] Jamie: No Tuesday night event?
[2016-09-06, 5:32:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Not this week. Next haha
[2016-09-06, 5:34:24 PM] Jamie: Nice. I'm probably going to BBQ some food if you are interested
[2016-09-06, 5:41:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I'm game. Done around 5:30
[2016-09-06, 5:48:12 PM] Jamie: Ok I will be home around 6:30
[2016-09-06, 8:05:29 PM] Rob Feeny: What can I bring? Beer?
[2016-09-06, 8:16:27 PM] Jamie: I have lots. Veggies?
[2016-09-06, 8:17:25 PM] Jamie: Just heading home now
[2016-09-06, 8:18:45 PM] Rob Feeny: K okay I'm nearby I'll grab some veggies and swing by
[2016-09-06, 8:24:00 PM] Jamie: And an orange plead
[2016-09-06, 8:24:03 PM] Jamie: Please
[2016-09-06, 8:24:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Craving some old old-fashioned are you?
[2016-09-06, 8:24:58 PM] Jamie: NO! That's what I drank on sat night. Oh god
[2016-09-06, 8:25:08 PM] Jamie: For chicken
[2016-09-06, 8:25:47 PM] Rob Feeny: You making your spicy Sriracha chicken again?
[2016-09-06, 8:26:11 PM] Jamie: It's an option. Or some sort of soya sauce and honey combo
[2016-09-06, 8:27:15 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm game for either so long as it's not too spicy
[2016-09-06, 8:45:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Home yet?
[2016-09-06, 8:53:03 PM] Jamie: Oh yea
[2016-09-07, 10:06:57 AM] Rob Feeny: Crap I was in bed by 10:30ish and slept til 7:30!
[2016-09-07, 10:21:14 AM] Jamie: Not bad, slacker
[2016-09-08, 10:07:42 AM] Jamie: Haha beet poop is terrifying
[2016-09-09, 3:54:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Beauty, the guy didn't dispute the accident and accepted responsibility
[2016-09-09, 4:47:42 PM] Rob Feeny: I think Sam is bailing on surfing, Deb still says yes. So I will probably be taking my car too, just remains to be seen what time
[2016-09-09, 4:52:34 PM] Jamie: Andrew said he would drive later
[2016-09-09, 4:55:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I saw that. Sucks tho because I'd rather go earlier but I guess if I want to do that I have to coordinate Deb getting a ride with him later
[2016-09-09, 4:55:58 PM] Rob Feeny: If I go with you
[2016-09-09, 6:01:16 PM] Jamie: Holy crap! It's $300 for a round trip for my truck and 5 people
[2016-09-09, 6:03:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Fack wow
[2016-09-09, 6:03:43 PM] Rob Feeny: $60 each plus gas
[2016-09-09, 6:08:26 PM] Jamie: Going to cottos with Jesse for a few around 6pm
[2016-09-09, 6:09:21 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm working with Morgan at Starbucks then heading to WCO to work more. I was there until 1:30 last night
[2016-09-09, 6:09:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks for the invite tho
[2016-09-09, 6:12:20 PM] Jamie: No worries
[2016-09-09, 6:33:06 PM] Jamie: Shayne is killing me. Lost the company credit card last weekend and today dropped his screwdriver and chipped a client's countertop. Fuckin hell
[2016-09-10, 8:36:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Christ. How many days left
[2016-09-10, 8:36:41 PM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2016-09-10, 8:36:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Someone dropped a drill and chipped a $2000 stove on Thursday at WCO
[2016-09-10, 8:37:17 PM] Jamie: That sucks. Shaynes last day is Wednesday
[2016-09-10, 9:39:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok fixing Anna's fence turned into 7 hours of hard labour on 4 hours of sleep
[2016-09-10, 9:39:08 PM] Rob Feeny: For $100
[2016-09-10, 9:39:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Plus a bottle of wine
[2016-09-10, 9:40:51 PM] Jamie: And her everlasting love!
[2016-09-11, 1:09:21 PM] Jamie: No campfire ban at the campsite next weekend. Makes sense, it's a rain forest
[2016-09-11, 1:09:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome. Stoked.
[2016-09-11, 1:09:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Suzanne is bailing I think
[2016-09-11, 1:11:28 PM] Jamie: That's ok. We will have at least 7 I think
[2016-09-11, 2:50:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey are you interested in an IKEA run this afternoon?
[2016-09-11, 2:51:51 PM] Jamie: Tempted but no. I'm fighting a sore throat and runny nose and need to be better by tomorrow. Netflix marathon. You could come grab the car, I'm not going anywhere
[2016-09-11, 2:52:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok maybe I'll do that in a couple hours
[2016-09-11, 4:04:24 PM] Jamie: What's your schedule on the ikea thing? I've gotta get out for a bit but just to the closest coffee shop
[2016-09-11, 4:34:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I fell asleep. Might put IKEA off for now
[2016-09-11, 4:35:15 PM] Jamie: All good. I'm just at cafe Artigiano. I couldn't sit on the couch any longer
[2016-09-11, 6:44:30 PM] Rob Feeny: You back home now?
[2016-09-11, 6:44:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Mind if I steal the car back for a bit?
[2016-09-11, 6:45:00 PM] Jamie: Yup I'm home. Feel free to grab
[2016-09-11, 6:45:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Cool
[2016-09-11, 7:48:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay I'm not losing my mind. It totally is the bay at Lougheed not Sears
[2016-09-11, 7:48:43 PM] Jamie: I thought you said Brentwood.  I get those mixed up all the time
[2016-09-11, 7:49:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay, I just drove by it and saw it and thought of it
[2016-09-11, 7:49:25 PM] Rob Feeny: I almost never go to Brentwood mall
[2016-09-11, 9:02:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Well that was a wasted trip to Ikea. I did my tour picked out all my things and they were out of stock on everything
[2016-09-11, 9:03:32 PM] Jamie: Crappy.  At least some hot chicks?
[2016-09-11, 9:04:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yah. Very distracting.
[2016-09-11, 9:11:29 PM] Jamie: Haha then not such a wasted trip, lol
[2016-09-11, 9:11:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Meh I could have seen girls at a mall
[2016-09-11, 10:37:44 PM] Jamie: What time do you think you will drop the car off?
[2016-09-11, 10:38:15 PM] Rob Feeny: About half an hour
[2016-09-11, 10:38:34 PM] Rob Feeny: That work for you?
[2016-09-11, 10:38:57 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-09-12, 3:26:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks kine Google maps allows up to 9 stops on a route now
[2016-09-12, 3:26:06 PM] Rob Feeny: *like
[2016-09-12, 3:26:28 PM] Jamie: That's pretty convenient
[2016-09-12, 3:27:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. It also seems to pause while you're at the stop you've programmed in. I came back to the car and it showed me "resume navigation"
[2016-09-12, 3:28:41 PM] Jamie: Smart. Makes sense that it can do that. Apple needs help, lol
[2016-09-12, 4:02:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey can you look in the trunk of my car and see if my hammock is there? No rush, just not sure where it is.
[2016-09-12, 4:04:24 PM] Jamie: Just in an appointment. Will check after
‎[2016-09-12, 4:52:59 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2016-09-12, 7:57:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah that's my hammock
[2016-09-12, 8:15:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Getting shit sorted? We're finishing here and have yet another stop to go
[2016-09-12, 8:20:28 PM] Jamie: Not much I can do. I had already set up interviews with all decent prospects to replace Shayne.
[2016-09-12, 8:30:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Netflix binging then?
[2016-09-12, 8:34:13 PM] Jamie: Plotting revenge actually. I am going to prioritize hiring an assistant and build all my systems like Apple does. Planned obsolescence. This time of employees. You can drop you phone in the toilet and be back up and running the next day. Why not with employees?
[2016-09-12, 8:34:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Smart. Engineer them out
[2016-09-12, 8:38:30 PM] Jamie: And fire them ruthlessly if they don't play ball. This is my fucking game and if they don't like, they are done.
[2016-09-12, 8:39:26 PM] Jamie: Shayne should've been fired the first time he walked off site and Sean should been fired when he didn't show me any respect about my truck. I assumed if I was loyal to them they would be loyal back and it's not working out that way
[2016-09-12, 10:18:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Aaaaand still going
[2016-09-12, 10:19:01 PM] Jamie: Yikes. What time did you start?
[2016-09-12, 10:19:42 PM] Rob Feeny: 9
[2016-09-12, 10:19:42 PM] Rob Feeny: So much for my IKEA trip
[2016-09-13, 12:40:55 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm still up I'm just driving back from having a beer with Morgan after working. I want to call?
[2016-09-13, 12:41:34 AM] Jamie: Nah it's ok. I need to sleep. Thanks though
[2016-09-13, 12:41:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay he hasn't asked me for any days yet and I haven't heard anything from the Westcoast outbuildings guys so I'm pretty much wide open
[2016-09-13, 11:04:34 AM] Rob Feeny: How are you today?
[2016-09-13, 11:05:04 AM] Jamie: Numb
[2016-09-13, 11:05:28 AM] Rob Feeny: Functioning?
[2016-09-13, 11:08:07 AM] Jamie: Oh yeah. The logistics of the next few days are staggering. In order to get my truck back unloaded, get Jesse into Shaynes van, and find a place to store the other vans by the time I leave, hurts my brain
[2016-09-13, 11:08:14 AM] Jamie: And the cold doesn't help
[2016-09-13, 11:08:46 AM] Jamie: And I'm sitting doing nothing waiting for an inspector that will show up at some point today.
[2016-09-13, 11:09:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Genny doesn't have a car, so you could put one at our place
[2016-09-13, 11:09:19 AM] Jamie: I asked Dan. He said only if you gave up your spot
[2016-09-13, 11:09:32 AM] Jamie: Thanks though.
[2016-09-13, 11:09:40 AM] Rob Feeny: You've got my car, so I'm not using my spot
[2016-09-13, 11:10:18 AM] Jamie: You will have your car back by Friday morning. Jesses van is to be picked up Sat
[2016-09-13, 11:10:41 AM] Jamie: I can park one in my spot at my house.
[2016-09-13, 11:11:05 AM] Jamie: The other might go to the street outside Jesses
[2016-09-13, 11:11:14 AM] Jamie: I almost have it figured out
[2016-09-13, 11:11:48 AM] Jamie: What are you doing today?
[2016-09-13, 11:14:31 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm at Starbucks trying to catch up my email/to-do list.  Heading to IKEA soon
[2016-09-13, 11:15:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Finally going to get a dresser, my bedroom shit's been in the living room for a month
[2016-09-13, 11:15:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Anything I can help with?
[2016-09-13, 11:19:09 AM] Jamie: I could probably use some company tonight but I'm sure you want to get your room set up. And I'm sick
[2016-09-13, 11:22:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Any interest in coming to my place? You can have a beer and chat while I build haha
[2016-09-13, 11:26:22 AM] Jamie: Possibly. We will see how my face feels. I have an interview with a guy at 5:30 at Starbucks
[2016-09-13, 11:27:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Keep me posted.
[2016-09-13, 11:27:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Just trying to nail down Deb for Tofino so I know if I will roll with you or Andrew
[2016-09-13, 11:32:26 AM] Jamie: Are you taking surfing lessons with me?
[2016-09-13, 11:32:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2016-09-13, 11:32:55 AM] Rob Feeny: $80 right?
[2016-09-13, 11:32:59 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-09-13, 11:33:01 AM] Jamie: Cool
[2016-09-13, 11:33:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Hope my heel doesn't cause a problem
[2016-09-13, 11:38:09 AM] Jamie: I don't think it would.
[2016-09-13, 11:38:45 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm going to see the doc again before we go
[2016-09-13, 11:40:12 AM] Rob Feeny: BTW I think I'm going to Taiwan in Nov. Been meaning to go for years, to see James
[2016-09-13, 11:40:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Found a dirt cheap flight
[2016-09-13, 11:40:54 AM] Jamie: Nice. Hope you don't miss my birthday!
[2016-09-13, 11:41:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha I wanted to sit down with you and plan your Bday so I can work around it. Haven't booked the flight yet.
[2016-09-13, 11:42:18 AM] Jamie: Cool. 19th is a sat so probably party at my place that day. And New Years
[2016-09-13, 3:32:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Man I could drop 2k here
[2016-09-13, 3:37:01 PM] Jamie: Haha yeah me too
[2016-09-13, 3:38:45 PM] Rob Feeny: At least it holds its value. The stuff I was looking at on Craigslist was always about 80 to 90% of the price of new
[2016-09-13, 6:53:30 PM] Jamie: Seriously fuck my life, haha. Both of the people I was supposed to interview today cancelled short notice. I'm sitting at Starbucks and no one is going to show up
[2016-09-13, 6:53:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah fuck
[2016-09-13, 6:54:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry phone was dead
[2016-09-13, 6:56:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Cancelled as in not interested or couldn't make it today?
[2016-09-13, 6:59:37 PM] Rob Feeny: If you're interested, I have chicken stew and salad here. Plus IKEA furniture to set up haha
[2016-09-13, 7:02:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Anyhow, taking a 15min snooze with my phone off, ttys
[2016-09-13, 7:33:14 PM] Rob Feeny: You ok?
[2016-09-13, 7:33:48 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah. Working on cleaning up Sean's documentation from today
[2016-09-13, 7:34:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-09-13, 7:34:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Was about to pedal down and check on yah haha
[2016-09-13, 7:34:55 PM] Jamie: I was in the phone with another electrician figuring something out for 30min.
[2016-09-13, 7:35:13 PM] Jamie: Signed a $5000 tesla install today. Got a $1300 deposit
[2016-09-13, 7:35:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice
[2016-09-13, 7:35:58 PM] Rob Feeny: That helps
[2016-09-13, 7:36:17 PM] Jamie: Yeah and it's at least a month away so I have time to find guys
[2016-09-13, 7:37:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Beauty. It'll happen.
[2016-09-13, 7:38:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Is it one confused see you at Starbucks at this hour?
[2016-09-13, 7:38:25 PM] Jamie: Haha yes a little
[2016-09-13, 7:38:39 PM] Jamie: The tall one doesn't give a shit. She is always so grumpy
[2016-09-13, 7:38:50 PM] Jamie: But I got a smile out of Nikki
[2016-09-13, 7:39:17 PM] Rob Feeny: The Texas girl?
[2016-09-13, 7:39:32 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-09-13, 7:39:53 PM] Rob Feeny: She's a bit odd but looks good in street clothes
[2016-09-13, 7:40:14 PM] Jamie: Oh she's cute for sure. But always kinda grumpy
[2016-09-13, 7:40:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe her husband doesn't fuck her properly
[2016-09-13, 8:09:05 PM] Jamie: Haha
[2016-09-13, 8:51:59 PM] Jamie: Sorry that I'm not coming by your place tonight man. My cold medication has worn off I feel like hell
[2016-09-13, 8:52:35 PM] Jamie: I am looking forward to seeing it after you've got it set up
[2016-09-13, 8:54:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok get better man
[2016-09-13, 9:51:40 PM] Rob Feeny: I've had really bad pain in both biceps since Saturday and thought it was the digging
[2016-09-13, 9:51:51 PM] Rob Feeny: But I'm just realizing it could be from the accident
[2016-09-13, 9:52:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Because of the way I absorbed the shock with my arms
[2016-09-13, 9:52:23 PM] Jamie: Getting worse or better?
[2016-09-13, 9:55:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Worse
[2016-09-13, 9:55:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Well.. I couldn't sleep Sat night
[2016-09-13, 9:55:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Then it was better but tonight just holding my arms anything but straight hurts a lot
[2016-09-13, 9:55:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm at 800mg of ibuprofen
[2016-09-13, 9:56:57 PM] Jamie: Think you sprained  your biceps?
[2016-09-13, 9:57:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Very possibly.
[2016-09-13, 9:58:25 PM] Jamie: Not much you can do but go to bed and hope it's better in the morning really
[2016-09-13, 9:59:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I'm starting to think maybe I should see a lawyer tho.
[2016-09-13, 9:59:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Bike is going back in the shop tomorrow because it's still not driving straight, I'm limping and my arms are not good
[2016-09-13, 10:02:05 PM] Jamie: That sucks Rob
[2016-09-13, 10:02:47 PM] Rob Feeny: I just hope it doesn't screw with Tofino!
[2016-09-13, 10:02:56 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll bring lots of ibuprofen
[2016-09-13, 10:03:15 PM] Jamie: I'll get you baked
[2016-09-13, 10:03:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahah that'll help. Might being some shrooms too
[2016-09-14, 8:54:50 AM] Jamie: I might see you at Shirley's today. Wait till you check out her yard
[2016-09-14, 9:01:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha ok. Morgan was talking about it the other night. Curious now.
[2016-09-14, 9:26:45 AM] Jamie: Any reason you know if that the solar panels can be stored up right? It looks like the guys leaned them
[2016-09-14, 9:27:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Shouldn't be a problem at all
[2016-09-14, 9:28:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Was thinking about that last night. We need to convince them to let us install them at some point.
[2016-09-14, 9:43:12 AM] Jamie: “Perfect is the enemy of good”
[2016-09-14, 9:43:22 AM] Jamie: Just read that. Love it
[2016-09-14, 9:52:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm deep
[2016-09-14, 9:52:44 AM] Rob Feeny: I've got "cheaters often prosper" in my headbfrom that thread of harsh truths from cute baby animals. It's so true and demoralizing.
[2016-09-14, 1:52:19 PM] Jamie: I can't wait to run tonight. I kind of want to kill someone right now
[2016-09-14, 1:53:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah maybe running is good
[2016-09-14, 1:53:20 PM] Rob Feeny: More bad news?
[2016-09-14, 1:53:26 PM] Jamie: Trying to deal with Royal Bank with these visas is a nightmare.
[2016-09-14, 1:54:13 PM] Jamie: The last time I canceled a visa there was interest left over but they delete the online account right away so I have no way of knowing that there's interest there or downloading the last of my transactions. The last two times I've had to request paper copies and it takes 20 days
[2016-09-14, 1:54:31 PM] Jamie: I tried to get confirmation that that wouldn't happen and I just talked in circles for an hour. And result who fucking knows what's going to happen
[2016-09-14, 1:56:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Lovely
[2016-09-14, 1:56:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yay banks. Record profits and record fees
[2016-09-14, 2:03:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm so unhappy with my bank but what else is there?
[2016-09-14, 2:03:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Could you just overpay it and then request a refund?
[2016-09-14, 2:03:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Won't you get a final statement in a month?
[2016-09-14, 2:04:38 PM] Jamie: That's the problem. Because I only get online statements they won't mail one. But they close the online account right away before the final statement comes out
[2016-09-14, 2:05:15 PM] Jamie: So I am missing all the transactions from the date of the last statement to the date that the account was closed. I have to put in a request after the date that it should've been issued to have it mailed
[2016-09-14, 2:06:00 PM] Jamie: I'm going to have to go in and screenshot it page by page
[2016-09-14, 2:06:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Switch to paper bills before shutting it down
[2016-09-14, 2:07:17 PM] Jamie: Haha right
[2016-09-14, 2:07:27 PM] Jamie: What do you think of the yard there?
[2016-09-14, 2:08:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Fricken ridiculous
[2016-09-14, 2:08:41 PM] Rob Feeny: This whole place...
[2016-09-14, 5:49:28 PM] Jamie: Just hired a guy. Journeyman with resi custom home experience in his past but just back from working up north. Nice guy, likes technology, married just had a baby
[2016-09-14, 6:03:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome
[2016-09-14, 6:03:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Sounds promising
[2016-09-14, 8:51:20 PM] Rob Feeny: So I hear you just had 2 spots open up
[2016-09-14, 9:24:33 PM] Rob Feeny: In your truck
[2016-09-14, 9:28:17 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-09-14, 9:55:53 PM] Rob Feeny: How was running? And Deb and I would take those spots. She lives on the way to the ferry, just in Lynne Valley
[2016-09-14, 10:02:08 PM] Jamie: Sounds good. How's your arm?
[2016-09-14, 10:17:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Sore. Going to the doc in the am
[2016-09-14, 10:17:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Another 12-hour day with Morgan
[2016-09-14, 10:21:11 PM] Jamie: At Shirley's?
[2016-09-14, 10:21:56 PM] Rob Feeny: No, the second half of the day at his place
[2016-09-14, 10:22:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Shirley had to go at 2
[2016-09-14, 10:22:36 PM] Jamie: Right. She is kinda odd hey?
[2016-09-14, 10:22:53 PM] Rob Feeny: She is. Insisted on saving all the old light bulbs and old Lutron pieces.
[2016-09-14, 10:23:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Her house was cool but it was way too sterile for me
[2016-09-14, 10:23:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm just headed to Fairmont now to take Morgan's freezer haha
[2016-09-14, 10:23:42 PM] Jamie: That's what we said. The were cob webs in some parts.
[2016-09-14, 10:23:49 PM] Rob Feeny: My Ikea furniture Ikea furniture will have to wait
[2016-09-14, 10:24:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you run out? Got some pent-up frustration out?
[2016-09-14, 10:25:24 PM] Jamie: Yup. It was a great group today maybe 13 people
[2016-09-14, 10:26:20 PM] Rob Feeny: anybody cute?
[2016-09-14, 10:28:56 PM] Jamie: Yeah this girl Lauren but she's very skinny. And I think she is dating josh, the guy coming this weekend.
[2016-09-14, 10:29:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Same. I'm dying to go running but my foot is still not good. I'm going to get fat!
[2016-09-14, 10:30:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't want to look like you!
[2016-09-14, 11:01:36 PM] Jamie: Haha
[2016-09-15, 10:03:19 AM] Rob Feeny: We're allowed 2 tents per site right?
[2016-09-15, 10:04:38 AM] Jamie: As many as you can fit was my understanding. The sites are sized for 2 4 man tents or any other combination
[2016-09-15, 10:05:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh awesome. Then she can bring her own. Yay for better sleep for me
[2016-09-15, 10:06:03 AM] Jamie: But no action, lol
[2016-09-15, 10:06:16 AM] Rob Feeny: 3711 Campbell Ave

[2016-09-15, 10:06:25 AM] Rob Feeny: God no. Not with Deb :S
[2016-09-15, 10:06:35 AM] Jamie: Haha it will be dark
[2016-09-15, 10:07:11 AM] Rob Feeny: That's where she's staying. We could also pick her up at the shop, which is only about 3 blocks off hwy 1 but she'll have to pedal her bike there with gear Haha.
[2016-09-15, 10:07:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Would you be ok with a detour to the house?
[2016-09-15, 10:08:06 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-09-15, 10:08:28 AM] Rob Feeny: Cool. I'll make sure she's organized. Waiting for a reply about the shelter from Dan
[2016-09-15, 10:08:59 AM] Jamie: I have to grab Kat first and the ferry is 12:50 so I have to pick her up at maybe 11:30ish
[2016-09-15, 10:09:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'll tell her 11:15
[2016-09-15, 10:09:51 AM] Jamie: Perfect
[2016-09-15, 10:10:14 AM] Rob Feeny: I could bring my car and stuff to your place and leave my car in your spot
[2016-09-15, 10:20:38 AM] Jamie: One van will be there
[2016-09-15, 2:54:35 PM] Jamie: What type of oil you want in your car?
[2016-09-15, 2:55:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Just standard.. 10w30 is the spec I think?
[2016-09-15, 2:57:10 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-09-15, 2:58:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Nothing special. Thanks man.
[2016-09-15, 3:30:55 PM] Jamie: Hey I can get your car detailed Monday but they don't open until 9 and I'm not sure what my schedule is. Or I can get you a gift card/ credit from this place near Willingdon. What works best?
[2016-09-15, 3:32:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Just the GC could work, I can take it in and work on my laptop while they do it.
[2016-09-15, 3:32:39 PM] Jamie: Cool will do
[2016-09-15, 3:32:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Or to save you a physical trip I can pay it and invoice you
[2016-09-15, 3:37:31 PM] Jamie: That might be best. He wouldn't be able to give me an invoice until you redeemed the gift certificate anyway
[2016-09-15, 3:56:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok that works
[2016-09-15, 3:57:17 PM] Jamie: What time Monday?
[2016-09-15, 4:05:32 PM] Rob Feeny: How about 12? I have physio at 9 then want to hit a lawyer
[2016-09-15, 4:15:30 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2016-09-15, 4:27:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you need help on Monday?
[2016-09-15, 4:29:26 PM] Jamie: No I think I can keep Kevin busy grabbing jesses van a putting it back together again. Wednesday for sure
[2016-09-15, 4:35:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'll keep it free
[2016-09-15, 4:39:44 PM] Jamie: Booked Monday at noon http://www.burnabyautospa.com
[2016-09-15, 4:39:57 PM] Jamie: Inside and out detailing
[2016-09-15, 4:47:36 PM] Jamie: Morgan wants you Tuesday. I can probably move you to wed at Clovelly walk
[2016-09-15, 4:48:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok no worries
[2016-09-15, 5:19:15 PM] Jamie: I am picking Kat up at 10:45am but coming all the way back to grab you would take longer I think. What's your plan for the morning?
[2016-09-15, 5:19:46 PM] Jamie: Wanna roll with me while I go to Canadian tire and then 1949 w 36th to check on the guys before I grab her?
[2016-09-15, 5:20:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. What time would you pick me up? Just need to plan around it.
[2016-09-15, 5:21:03 PM] Jamie: 8?
[2016-09-15, 5:26:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok I'll pack late tonight
[2016-09-15, 5:27:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Been getting home from work at 10pm
[2016-09-15, 5:27:07 PM] Jamie: Yeah me too
[2016-09-15, 6:02:48 PM] Jamie: Now that I think about it with downtown traffic and backtracking from Taylor way to debs place if I go through downtown, it would be the same amount of time for me to grab you at my place at 11am instead. Better?
[2016-09-15, 6:03:47 PM] Jamie: You can grab your car anytime
[2016-09-15, 6:05:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure yah that works well. I have to pick my bike up from the shop so I can pack and do that
[2016-09-15, 9:06:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Will you be home in an hour for me to grab my car?
[2016-09-15, 9:16:58 PM] Jamie: Nope
[2016-09-15, 9:17:12 PM] Jamie: I won't be home until about 10ish
[2016-09-15, 9:17:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah damn. Shop didn't finish my bike so I'm transiting home from Fairmont
[2016-09-15, 9:17:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-09-15, 9:18:07 PM] Jamie: You could climb on my balcony
[2016-09-15, 9:18:11 PM] Jamie: Your keys are on the counter
[2016-09-15, 9:18:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha kinda sketchy. I'll. Just stay on the bus until it gets to my place.
[2016-09-15, 9:18:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Come back with keys later
[2016-09-15, 9:25:10 PM] Jamie: Ok sounds good
[2016-09-15, 9:32:41 PM] Jamie: Do you have cast iron pan?
[2016-09-15, 9:33:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmmm good question. I'll look. I seem to remember Jane leaving one.
[2016-09-15, 10:39:04 PM] Jamie: Heading home now. We should try and get that tarp and shelter
[2016-09-15, 10:39:15 PM] Jamie: And I have your camping chair
[2016-09-15, 10:40:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome.
[2016-09-15, 10:40:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Dan OK'd the shelter
[2016-09-15, 10:40:59 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll dig out some rope and bungies
[2016-09-15, 10:46:09 PM] Jamie: What about a crib bored?
[2016-09-15, 10:46:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Got one. I'll bring it.
[2016-09-15, 10:46:49 PM] Jamie: Nice!
[2016-09-15, 10:47:05 PM] Jamie: I think a table would be nice but I don't know if we're gonna be able to pull one together
[2016-09-15, 10:54:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry was talking to Jenny
[2016-09-15, 10:54:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Genny
[2016-09-15, 10:54:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I have a couple little wooden TV tables but no proper table
[2016-09-15, 10:57:12 PM] Jamie: Do you want me to grab you and bring you back to your car?
[2016-09-16, 11:06:32 AM] Jamie: We will probably need 10 bags of ice
[2016-09-16, 11:57:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok no problem
[2016-09-16, 11:58:14 AM] Rob Feeny: My phone decided that this morning was a good time to update the os for an hour
[2016-09-16, 11:58:50 AM] Jamie: Haha fuckin technology. We might be early back to my place. You on schedule?
[2016-09-16, 12:10:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. Plan is to leave my place at 10:30 and 15min for ice and beer, 15min to get to your place
[2016-09-16, 12:12:04 PM] Jamie: Ok should be good.
[2016-09-16, 12:12:19 PM] Jamie: I have a case of Budweiser you can have
[2016-09-16, 12:13:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok awesome.
[2016-09-16, 12:14:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks
[2016-09-16, 12:29:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you want all 10 bags now or want to buy some in Nanaimo or along the way?
[2016-09-16, 12:31:16 PM] Jamie: Makes sense let's get six bags then to back sprinkler
[2016-09-16, 12:37:50 PM] Rob Feeny: I have no idea what the end of that message means but I'm just going to get 6 bags for you
[2016-09-16, 1:00:14 PM] Jamie: ETA?
[2016-09-16, 1:00:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm at your truck
[2016-09-16, 5:01:54 PM] Rob Feeny: That I could borrow there's a market in the mall here we're just going to get her some food so we don't slow you down
[2016-09-19, 2:17:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow that's some detail package! 4 hours and $200!
[2016-09-19, 2:17:40 PM] Jamie: He didn't say 4 hrs but I knew the price
[2016-09-19, 2:18:30 PM] Rob Feeny: They said it should be ready at 5:30 or 6 o'clock
[2016-09-19, 2:18:42 PM] Rob Feeny: So I was trying to get out of him why it would take so long and he said they will work on it for 4 hours!
[2016-09-19, 2:19:25 PM] Jamie: Well they did say inside and out. Let me know how it looks, I might put my truck in
[2016-09-19, 2:19:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Will do. It will probably look better than new haha
[2016-09-19, 8:11:52 PM] Rob Feeny: So I know I'm going to that job tomorrow morning, but do you know when else you could use me this week? I'm going to fill any times you don't need me with Morgan and WC Outbuildings
[2016-09-19, 8:12:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Just so I don't fall behind
[2016-09-19, 8:15:28 PM] Jamie: I can use you Thursday, Friday. Wednesday I could have you help me with just misc stuff I falling behind with

[2016-09-19, 8:17:13 PM] Jamie: Beautiful
[2016-09-19, 8:17:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Bad voice to text. They cleaned the inside of the rims
[2016-09-19, 8:17:59 PM] Rob Feeny: It's spotless. Thank you.
[2016-09-19, 8:32:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok Wed morning I have physio and someone wants to do a networking lunch date. Could you use me Wed afternoon? Otherwise I'll probably do some SuperVans work for Morgan

[2016-09-19, 8:44:54 PM] Jamie: I'm failing at building ikea furniture, lol
[2016-09-19, 8:51:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Smoked too much weed?
[2016-09-19, 8:54:05 PM] Jamie: Probably. Haha. I sent you an invite for the morning
[2016-09-19, 8:56:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Accepted. The client is expecting me at 8am, correct? New Moon doesn't open until 8am, says Google
[2016-09-19, 9:02:51 PM] Jamie: They are open at 7.  And I told her you would just show up at 8am and you don't need in the house. So you would just get to work. She is super nice
[2016-09-19, 9:03:13 PM] Jamie: It's not really a problem if you are a few minutes late
[2016-09-19, 9:03:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok good to know, thanks
[2016-09-20, 9:40:37 AM] Jamie: Any problem picking up the lights?
[2016-09-20, 9:41:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope. I've got them just had to make a stop for some strippers because I think I left mine at Westcoast
[2016-09-20, 9:41:48 AM] Rob Feeny: They didn't have the cash but said that you were going to steal 3 from from other lights on site? Shall I do that on site?
[2016-09-20, 9:42:14 AM] Jamie: Ok. Call me when you get there and take a look. Yes grab cowls from some other areas for now so we don't have to climb the trees again
[2016-09-20, 9:46:34 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-09-20, 9:48:49 AM] Rob Feeny: What's the client's name BTW?
[2016-09-20, 9:49:06 AM] Jamie: Carol
[2016-09-20, 9:49:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Pk
[2016-09-20, 10:51:43 AM] Jamie: Call me. I can send Kevin to help you
[2016-09-20, 10:57:32 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎Missed voice call
[2016-09-20, 12:57:49 PM] Rob Feeny: I am supposed to be reusing the old screw in bases?
[2016-09-20, 1:30:12 PM] Jamie: Will that work?
[2016-09-20, 1:30:49 PM] Rob Feeny: I think that's what she did but I couldn't for the life of me get it off with the tools I have I am headed to Home Depot to get something
[2016-09-20, 1:32:20 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2016-09-20, 1:32:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Brought a full tool kit but my monkey wrench isn't big enough
[2016-09-20, 1:46:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes the old bases will work. It was full of tree sap. Fun to get off.
[2016-09-20, 1:49:39 PM] Jamie: Great news
[2016-09-20, 1:49:43 PM] Jamie: Having fun?
[2016-09-20, 1:50:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha kinda. It's nerve wracking at times even though I have 2 safeties
[2016-09-20, 2:57:25 PM] Jamie: You alive?
‎[2016-09-20, 3:07:36 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
‎[2016-09-20, 3:07:44 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-09-20, 3:07:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I stopped to grab a bite of lunch and I'm back here.
[2016-09-20, 3:08:21 PM] Jamie: Ok just checking
[2016-09-20, 3:08:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm just about this place in the light but I always thought the marked wire was positive but I swear there's a couple little negative symbols on the marked wire
[2016-09-20, 3:10:03 PM] Jamie: I'm pretty sure they are AC lights
[2016-09-20, 3:10:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Just low voltage AC?
[2016-09-20, 3:10:40 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-09-20, 3:10:54 PM] Rob Feeny: When you said they were 12 volts I assumed I assumed DC
[2016-09-20, 3:11:33 PM] Rob Feeny: So the marked wire is negative?
[2016-09-20, 3:11:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Who designed this shit?
[2016-09-20, 3:12:49 PM] Jamie: There is no negative with AC. Pretty sure you can hook it up anyway you want
[2016-09-20, 3:13:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-09-20, 4:09:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn it that one on the ground was not the third it was the 4th
[2016-09-20, 4:15:24 PM] Jamie: Just make sure the tree ones are done.
[2016-09-20, 4:16:33 PM] Rob Feeny: There are three in the tree she thought there was only two. I will switch out the one on the ground to do the third tree and when you bring the cowls you can bring a 4th
[2016-09-20, 4:25:08 PM] Jamie: Ok sounds good
‎[2016-09-20, 6:19:25 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2016-09-20, 6:31:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Still sending, not sure why
[2016-09-20, 7:18:25 PM] Jamie: Got a second to chat
[2016-09-20, 7:18:27 PM] Jamie: ?
[2016-09-20, 7:18:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2016-09-29, 9:54:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey I just got a letter for a parking ticket on Commercial on Sept 7th
[2016-09-29, 9:56:27 PM] Jamie: Oops yeah I paid one but not that. I tried to pay it the other day but Vancouver.ca was down. I will try tomorrow
[2016-09-29, 9:56:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool thanks
[2016-10-03, 8:38:57 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob. 1949 W. 36th is almost ready to have at least the racking installed and potentially the solar panels. Are you still interested in the install?
[2016-10-03, 8:56:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Certainly. How far out are we looking? I'll coordinate with Morgan.
[2016-10-03, 8:58:17 PM] Jamie: Probably best if you coordinate with Kris directly on scheduling. We talked about it today and he said just to get you to give him a call in the next few days
[2016-10-03, 9:13:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sounds good, will do.
[2016-10-03, 9:22:01 PM] Jamie: Thanks
[2016-10-04, 5:16:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey I've got David Harroch from VREC asking about payment. Shall I tell him the panels are going on ASAP and we're still waiting on the client?
[2016-10-05, 10:17:15 AM] Jamie: Hey I have to leave but I have that bank draft. You near the Starbucks?
[2016-10-05, 10:56:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Sorry I was in Physio and forgot my phone in the van
[2016-10-05, 10:56:50 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm headed towards Fairmont and then West 36th 1430 are you anywhere in those areas?
[2016-10-05, 10:57:21 AM] Jamie: Nope. I am meeting an inspector in Burnaby then west van
[2016-10-05, 10:57:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay where in Burnaby? Maybe I can swing by.
[2016-10-05, 10:57:48 AM] Jamie: Then commercial Ave for 3pm
[2016-10-05, 10:58:13 AM] Jamie: I am at 2989 southcrest. Super close
[2016-10-05, 11:00:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok will you still be there in 30-40 min?
[2016-10-05, 11:01:06 AM] Jamie: I don't think so. Inspector is here any minute. Maybe I can drop it in the recycling bin outside my old entrance at your place
[2016-10-05, 11:02:15 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok, I'm just here to shower and eat and take off, will that take you out of your way?
[2016-10-05, 11:03:31 AM] Rob Feeny: If so I'll hop in the van and drive over now
[2016-10-05, 11:04:15 AM] Jamie: Nope that's fine. Not sure how long I will be though.
[2016-10-05, 11:04:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-10-05, 11:07:40 AM] Jamie: I will know my schedule better when the inspector actually shows up
[2016-10-05, 11:08:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Sure no problem
[2016-10-05, 11:35:00 AM] Rob Feeny: Headed your way
[2016-10-05, 11:35:31 AM] Jamie: Just leafy heading your way 5 min
[2016-10-05, 11:36:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay want to meet at Starbucks?
[2016-10-05, 11:36:35 AM] Rob Feeny: Chris is behind so I'm not so rushed
[2016-10-05, 11:37:01 AM] Jamie: K
[2016-10-05, 2:58:15 PM] Rob Feeny: They're good for installing everything, looking at week after next for availability to get in there. Want to sit down soon and go over what your guys need to do? Really I think the only part that takes an electrian is getting the wire from the roof tie-in to the panel but want to sit and sort it out?
[2016-10-05, 2:59:48 PM] Jamie: I think we will have to have at least a couple of combiner boxes underneath the panels somewhere. We would be taking a scene from each group thing and then bringing it to a box where I can go a single wire down to the bottom
[2016-10-05, 3:00:20 PM] Jamie: I would schedule to have it in stall and we can figure out the high-voltage side of it as we go. I wouldn't be dependent on me because I'm very busy
[2016-10-05, 3:01:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I'll get the racking / panels sorted and update you.
[2016-10-05, 3:04:56 PM] Jamie: Cool thanks
[2016-10-05, 3:05:33 PM] Jamie: Did BR EC get there check?
[2016-10-05, 3:09:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Just in my way there
[2016-10-05, 3:09:36 PM] Jamie: They will be happy
[2016-10-05, 3:22:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Delivered.
[2016-10-05, 3:22:41 PM] Jamie: Thanks
[2016-10-09, 10:12:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Any update on Morgan and Melissa?
[2016-10-16, 7:16:05 PM] Rob Feeny: So is that van on by your place until tomorrow evening or do I need to come get it tonight?
[2016-10-16, 7:17:24 PM] Jamie: It's at the repair shop. I'm grabbing tomorrow.
[2016-10-16, 7:18:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok perfect.
[2016-10-17, 5:52:37 PM] Jamie: I have the van. Not too bad in the back
[2016-10-17, 5:54:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome
[2016-10-17, 9:17:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Jamie, is Morgan's son ok?
[2016-10-17, 9:17:40 PM] Rob Feeny: A few things he said that made me wonder but it's too delicate a thing to ask about
[2016-10-17, 11:21:04 PM] Jamie: well Melissa is on methadone so the baby was born addicted to opiates. It's going to take a month to wean the baby off of it. Probably not something he wants the world to know
[2016-10-17, 11:22:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Thanks. I didn't want to ask but was worried.
[2016-10-17, 11:22:31 PM] Jamie: I'm pretty sure they did the research before they had the baby doing she was it addicted to methadone
[2016-10-17, 11:22:39 PM] Jamie: This was expected
[2016-10-17, 11:22:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Not going to say a word to anyone but he seems very distracted and stressed.
[2016-10-17, 11:23:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I didn't realize she was on something that strong
[2016-10-17, 11:23:39 PM] Jamie: Yeah it's probably tough. And I know he hasn't been sleeping well at the hospital
[2016-10-17, 11:31:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah he stopped at the hospital before jobs and when I drove past Children's and realized it was the hospital that was on the way...
[2016-10-18, 9:02:35 AM] Jamie: What time are you grabbing the van?
[2016-10-18, 9:03:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Was going to leave my place in about 5min to head to you
[2016-10-18, 9:05:09 AM] Rob Feeny: You're just able to buzz me in right?
[2016-10-18, 9:05:16 AM] Jamie: Yes
[2016-10-18, 9:05:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok perfect.
[2016-10-18, 9:05:51 AM] Jamie: Keys are on the island. Battery on the remote might be low but it should be fine. Triple a if you have it
[2016-10-18, 9:06:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Thanks. Gonna be a fun one in the rain 👍🏻
[2016-10-18, 9:07:24 AM] Jamie: Oh yeah. We are doing a BC hydro service upgrade and the trench is full of water I'm sure
[2016-10-18, 9:07:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Yay Vancouver!
[2016-10-18, 9:23:58 AM] Jamie: My apartment door will be open for 60 seconds
[2016-10-18, 9:24:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Got the key
[2016-10-18, 9:24:28 AM] Rob Feeny: You can relock
[2016-10-18, 9:24:42 AM] Jamie: It will auto lock
[2016-10-18, 11:49:07 AM] Rob Feeny: I finally found the lag bolts and washers for the solar job but I think the guys used them as stock and all the washers and half the lag bolts are gone. Is there a better place to buy them then Home Depot nearby?
[2016-10-18, 11:49:59 AM] Jamie: We don't use lag bolts for anything.
[2016-10-18, 11:55:23 AM] Jamie: The best place is near my storage
[2016-10-18, 11:55:57 AM] Jamie: Or maybe the Hilton store. Any fastener place. BC fasteners or someplace like that?
[2016-10-18, 11:56:00 AM] Rob Feeny: Interesting. Maybe they fell out? I'll search more. If not, HD supply?
[2016-10-18, 11:56:05 AM] Jamie: Hilti
[2016-10-18, 11:56:11 AM] Jamie: But hat would be expensive
[2016-10-18, 11:58:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah I'll do home Depot. I think the originals came from there.
[2016-10-18, 12:17:25 PM] Jamie: Ok cool. Send me the receipt and I will reimburse. Or invoice me
[2016-10-18, 3:33:58 PM] Jamie: Any chance you're taking pictures as you go?

[2016-10-18, 3:34:46 PM] Jamie: Nice!! We have the shelter out today to

[2016-10-18, 4:26:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Late start, took a while to load and get bolts etc
[2016-10-18, 4:26:52 PM] Jamie: Hope the messy van  didn't slow you down
[2016-10-18, 5:55:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Well Craig is a nice guy but I was expecting more from a guy with 20yrs of construction experience and a diploma in renewable energy systems
[2016-10-18, 5:56:08 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah?
[2016-10-18, 5:56:57 PM] Rob Feeny: We only just finished putting all the standoffs on. I had to teach him how to drill straight and he broke 3 bits.
[2016-10-18, 6:00:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm going to bill less for him
[2016-10-18, 6:02:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm not worried about money I just want this done
[2016-10-18, 6:45:35 PM] Jamie: Any chance there is a black power bar in that van anywhere?
[2016-10-18, 6:46:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Haven't seen one
[2016-10-18, 6:48:17 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2016-10-18, 6:48:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Rob will have the parts tomorrow but I will have to talk to Morgan about when I can get back to this site and when I can get the helper again
[2016-10-18, 6:49:15 PM] Jamie: Ok no problem. We still have tons of work there. Just let Kris know
[2016-10-18, 9:38:19 PM] Rob Feeny: So we didn't actually mount any panels because they were so packaged nicely in the back of the van that I didn't want to leave half of them flopping loose. Plus Craig had to to home. Kris is up to date, looking at whether we can go there Thursday.
[2016-10-18, 9:40:22 PM] Jamie: Ok sounds good. Just finishing up?
[2016-10-18, 9:49:15 PM] Rob Feeny: No just got home. Rails went in very nicely. Dead level. They go in pretty quickly, it was the 96 lag bolts into perfectly lined up holes, filled with roofing seal that was the challenge.
[2016-10-19, 1:03:45 PM] Rob Feeny: So the new feet Rob brought in are the wrong size (same as the ones we have that don't fit). He's working on getting the right ones. I'll keep you updated.
[2016-10-19, 1:04:17 PM] Jamie: Ok sounds good
[2016-10-19, 4:30:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Never seen Lutron done like this before...
‎[2016-10-19, 4:32:10 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-10-19, 4:35:43 PM] Jamie: Orca security. Besides the fact that these RF devices are in a giant metal box, when you open that up its a giant mess of wires, almost impossible to troubleshoot.
[2016-10-19, 4:36:08 PM] Jamie: But that box looks different. Is it PCB brand?
[2016-10-19, 4:36:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahh ok. Morgan loved it
[2016-10-19, 4:37:09 PM] Jamie: Yeah I love the idea but we fought with signal when we swapped took over a system like this. If I could get plastic....
[2016-10-19, 4:37:14 PM] Jamie: What brand is it?
[2016-10-19, 4:44:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Code brand
‎[2016-10-19, 4:44:59 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-10-19, 4:47:21 PM] Jamie: Ohhhhh you can get a lexan door. Poly carbonate.
[2016-10-19, 4:49:29 PM] Jamie: I didn't know that. Thanks
[2016-10-19, 4:50:51 PM] Rob Feeny: No problem. It's the only thing well done in this house!
[2016-10-21, 4:03:48 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm calling Rob Baxter every day but have no update.
[2016-10-21, 4:04:37 PM] Rob Feeny: If he doesn't have a time line for me by Monday I'm going to just find a machine shop to give me a quote to ream them out. It's not a complex job.
[2016-10-21, 6:21:36 PM] Jamie: Ok thanks for the update
[2016-10-21, 9:22:10 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob are you watching shows on my Netflix account?
[2016-10-21, 9:22:35 PM] Rob Feeny: No
[2016-10-21, 9:22:41 PM] Rob Feeny: I use Morgan's
[2016-10-21, 9:23:28 PM] Jamie: Totally weird. I think there must be a glitch on Apple TV then because every time I go back to my Netflix it's on a different series playing.
[2016-10-21, 9:24:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Didn't use it at a client's place?
[2016-10-21, 9:25:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Mom?
[2016-10-21, 9:25:44 PM] Jamie: Nope. Maybe Jesse. I will change my password, haha
[2016-10-21, 9:34:19 PM] Rob Feeny: So is my car still there? I'm going to move it tomorrow.
[2016-10-21, 9:34:28 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2016-10-21, 9:35:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Cool
[2016-10-26, 12:02:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Are you guys on the site at 1949 West 36th tomorrow?
[2016-10-26, 12:02:58 AM] Rob Feeny: I ended up drilling out all those mounts myself and we're going to install the rest of the stuff tomorrow
[2016-10-26, 12:05:49 AM] Jamie: Ok great. The guys will be there all day. I might be able to stop by but talk to Sam.
[2016-10-26, 12:06:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2016-10-26, 12:18:20 PM] Jamie: How is it going?
[2016-10-26, 12:20:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Decently. Soggy.
‎[2016-10-26, 7:03:03 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
‎[2016-10-26, 7:03:11 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-10-26, 7:04:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Need some extensions from VREC for the inverter / panel cables and need to talk about grounding with them.
[2016-10-26, 7:05:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Haven't out the junction box on yet either but went over it with Sam. Have measurements for conduit to bridge rows as well. Will summarize everything in an email tonight.
[2016-10-26, 7:09:16 PM] Jamie: Looks pretty cool! When are you back?
[2016-10-26, 7:11:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Honestly it'll have to be next week. Once I know about the grounding I can sort out a nice conduit solution. Have to thread the wires through the conduit before VREC terminates them because the connectors are huge.
[2016-10-26, 7:12:17 PM] Jamie: Ok no problem. We have time. They paid last week
‎[2016-10-26, 7:12:16 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2016-10-26, 7:12:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Got any nice outdoor 12/3 like that in stock?
[2016-10-26, 7:13:01 PM] Jamie: No. They may cut it at the wholesaler though
[2016-10-26, 7:13:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Need 2 @ 225" lengths and 1 @ 200, I'll take it to VREC for crimping the connectors on. They have a special crimper.
[2016-10-26, 7:13:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok beauty. I can do all that in my car. I'll have the van ready to go tonight.
[2016-10-26, 7:16:05 PM] Jamie: Ok so you want to drop it off tonight? I don't need it right away but you probably want to get rid of it.
[2016-10-26, 7:16:13 PM] Jamie: I will be home around 8:30
[2016-10-26, 7:16:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah because the neighbor pushed that cement block into one of the front spots
[2016-10-26, 9:41:37 PM] Jamie: I will be home in 10 minutes
[2016-10-26, 9:42:22 PM] Rob Feeny: I won't be there till about 8:30
[2016-10-26, 9:42:33 PM] Jamie: That's fine
[2016-10-26, 10:35:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Got the van sorted. If I head over can you give me a ride back?
[2016-10-26, 10:43:16 PM] Jamie: Right I didn't think about that. I'm in my pajamas and I have food in the oven. What's your morning like? I am heading to Starbucks first thing
[2016-10-26, 10:44:02 PM] Rob Feeny: It's all good I will take the bus
[2016-10-26, 10:44:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm headed to Whistler at 6:30 a.m.
[2016-10-29, 1:13:23 PM] Jamie: Do you care if I feature you in a Feeny power post about this install?
[2016-10-29, 1:20:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope
[2016-10-29, 1:22:53 PM] Jamie: Cool. I will take you and make you famous
[2016-10-29, 1:23:09 PM] Jamie: Tag*
[2016-10-29, 1:24:44 PM] Jamie: Have any other pics? Maybe if the invertors?
[2016-10-29, 1:36:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah gimme a few, just with Tana
[2016-10-29, 2:03:28 PM] Rob Feeny: They say Hi

[2016-11-02, 9:22:02 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2016-11-03, 2:34:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks like we're not going to that site until tomorrow, can you send me Kevin's number and I'll get him to make my measurements for me
[2016-11-03, 2:35:19 PM] Jamie: He may not be able to get on the roof. But +1 (778) 995-2019
[2016-11-03, 2:39:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah yes forgot about that. Thx
‎[2016-11-07, 10:14:43 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2016-11-07, 10:16:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup.
[2016-11-07, 10:16:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm from the surf trip?
[2016-11-07, 10:16:51 AM] Jamie: Yup. In the back passenger door handle
[2016-11-07, 10:20:29 AM] Rob Feeny: You at Starbucks?
[2016-11-07, 10:20:42 AM] Jamie: Nope. Onsite today
[2016-11-07, 10:29:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok no worries
[2016-11-07, 10:30:27 AM] Jamie: I haven't had a chance to call ECS. Do you want to try giving a call and see if you could source that wire?
[2016-11-07, 10:31:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I plan on swinging by the site later today if I can, to make the measurement too. Should be nearby this afternoon or tomorrow.
[2016-11-07, 3:39:00 PM] Rob Feeny: So I figure you would know, I'm out at the jobsite where you picked up Morgan last week. I need to be basically at your storage locker area at 6pm. Would it be faster to take the second narrows or Lions gate? And how early should I leave site?
[2016-11-07, 3:39:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I know the traffic will be a nightmare
[2016-11-07, 3:41:22 PM] Jamie: Second narrows. Almost always. Are you getting there for 6 because it closes? I think those are office hours and the place is 24hr access.
[2016-11-07, 3:43:02 PM] Jamie: It's actually from 5 AM till 10 PM
[2016-11-07, 3:43:09 PM] Rob Feeny: No, I'm actually heading to a climbing gym a block away to meet a friend. Won't be hitting the solar site until tomorrow
[2016-11-07, 3:43:22 PM] Rob Feeny: But knew that you would know the transit time
[2016-11-07, 3:43:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Just trying to maximize my time on site
[2016-11-07, 3:44:35 PM] Jamie: I would leave no later than five
[2016-11-07, 3:44:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok thanks.
[2016-11-07, 3:45:12 PM] Rob Feeny: BTW I met a guy who was working with VREC lately and he confirmed that they're just a mess, it's not us.
[2016-11-07, 3:46:16 PM] Rob Feeny: He suggested aluminum unistrut/channel because if it's open it's not conduit and the AC/DC can be together. Once I can measure it I'll look at options
[2016-11-07, 3:49:27 PM] Jamie: Ok sounds good
[2016-11-07, 3:49:36 PM] Jamie: I have guys on site today
[2016-11-07, 3:51:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, maybe I'll call Kevin and walk him through it
[2016-11-07, 7:42:38 PM] Rob Feeny: So the aluminum unistrut is $130 at HD Supply. Conduit is looking better.
[2016-11-07, 7:45:13 PM] Rob Feeny: But then again, what would be the cost of fabbing custom mounts to attach the conduit to the standoff?
[2016-11-07, 10:35:38 PM] Jamie: $130 total?
[2016-11-07, 10:35:59 PM] Jamie: Sorry was working on a Hydro service all day. Was brutal
[2016-11-07, 10:36:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes for a 20-foot length which is exactly what we need once it's cut in 3
[2016-11-07, 10:36:12 PM] Jamie: That's fine
[2016-11-07, 10:36:36 PM] Rob Feeny: No worries I made it there just before they close to get a price. They need 24 hours to bring it in
[2016-11-07, 10:37:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I think the wire place closed at 4:30 but I'm going to try them again in the morning
[2016-11-07, 10:38:39 PM] Jamie: OK sounds good. I'm on site again tomorrow so I'll be useless. And if you need money you should hit me with the progress invoice because I have cash now
[2016-11-07, 10:50:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay
[2016-11-15, 2:08:47 PM] Rob Feeny: So what's your comfort level with using a different outdoor-rated 12/3 wire?
[2016-11-15, 2:09:02 PM] Rob Feeny: The manufacturer is sending me the spec sheet on The Wire and suggested we Source something that means the same specs
[2016-11-15, 2:09:35 PM] Rob Feeny: But the guy is sounding like anything mostly similar should work
[2016-11-17, 9:24:18 PM] Jamie: Hmm I just got this
[2016-11-17, 9:27:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I realized that so I called you. That's the beauty of WhatsApp
‎[2016-11-25, 11:26:34 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎Contact card omitted
[2016-11-26, 11:10:58 PM] Jamie: What time should I be at your place?
[2016-11-26, 11:32:38 PM] Rob Feeny: 10am
[2016-11-27, 12:54:34 AM] Jamie: Ok
[2016-11-27, 12:55:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man
[2016-11-27, 12:27:55 PM] Jamie: Any chance you are ready early?
[2016-11-27, 12:38:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2016-11-27, 12:38:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Over at Dan's
[2016-12-11, 9:34:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey when are you back from Nica?
[2016-12-11, 9:48:20 PM] Jamie: The 30th
[2016-12-11, 9:49:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. And you leave the 15th?
[2016-12-11, 9:54:55 PM] Jamie: Yup. Not sure what time. Just out to dinner
[2016-12-11, 10:03:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Np
[2016-12-11, 11:26:26 PM] Jamie: Leave the 15th at 7:25pm
[2016-12-11, 11:26:33 PM] Jamie: How's Taiwan?
[2016-12-11, 11:28:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Pretty freaking cool
[2016-12-11, 11:28:43 PM] Jamie: Speak any mandarin?

[2016-12-11, 11:34:45 PM] Jamie: Is it expensive there?
[2016-12-11, 11:35:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Sev has some weird shit here

[2016-12-11, 11:36:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Got my teeth cleaned for $60
[2016-12-11, 11:36:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Suit tailored quite well for $70
[2016-12-11, 11:36:47 PM] Jamie: How are the women?
[2016-12-11, 11:38:35 PM] Rob Feeny: You'd love them
[2016-12-11, 11:38:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Met a few cute ones but it's nothing like Vancouver
[2016-12-11, 11:42:37 PM] Rob Feeny: But they like foreign guys
[2016-12-11, 11:43:19 PM] Jamie: Haha I bet. No hot ex pats?
[2016-12-11, 11:43:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope most are male
[2016-12-13, 5:40:48 PM] Jamie: When you get in tomorrow?
[2016-12-13, 5:41:38 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm on the bus home right now
[2016-12-13, 5:41:53 PM] Jamie: I thought you came back on the 15th
[2016-12-13, 5:41:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Figured you were working during the day
[2016-12-13, 5:42:04 PM] Rob Feeny: And it wasn't a long ride
[2016-12-13, 5:42:18 PM] Rob Feeny: No, 13th, 2 days before you leave
[2016-12-13, 5:42:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Back to work 15th
[2016-12-13, 5:42:43 PM] Rob Feeny: But nothing scheduled so no issues getting you to the airport
[2016-12-13, 5:43:04 PM] Jamie: My flight got changed so my flights now at 7:05 PM
[2016-12-13, 5:43:11 PM] Jamie: Maybe at the airport by five?
[2016-12-13, 5:43:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok no problem
[2016-12-14, 2:35:50 PM] Jamie: Hey what's the best way to call people in Nicaragua?
[2016-12-14, 4:20:01 PM] Rob Feeny: On the phone works just fine but will probably cost you 50c a minute
[2016-12-14, 4:20:38 PM] Jamie: I bought some Skype credit
[2016-12-14, 4:21:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok that should work. I just slept from 11pm last night until now
[2016-12-14, 4:21:15 PM] Jamie:  Wow
[2016-12-14, 4:24:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugh yah. Yay jetlag
[2016-12-14, 11:06:26 PM] Jamie: Hey do you have a very small bag that I can take on this trip?
[2016-12-14, 11:06:34 PM] Jamie: Did I give you that Panasonic one strap one?
[2016-12-14, 11:08:41 PM] Rob Feeny: No I don't think so. I have a running pack that is my smallest
[2016-12-14, 11:08:57 PM] Jamie: Like a camel back?
[2016-12-14, 11:09:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. Not really optimal as a day pack
[2016-12-14, 11:09:23 PM] Jamie: Too big?
[2016-12-14, 11:09:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Otherwise my smallest is  42L pack
[2016-12-14, 11:09:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Too small
[2016-12-14, 11:10:02 PM] Jamie: Really the smaller the better. Just has to fit my towel and my book
[2016-12-14, 11:10:25 PM] Jamie: Or I bite the bullet and lug my full back pack
[2016-12-14, 11:15:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm ok I'll send you a pic
[2016-12-14, 11:17:30 PM] Jamie: Thanks

[2016-12-14, 11:23:47 PM] Jamie: Perfect

[2016-12-14, 11:24:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok its in my. Car
[2016-12-14, 11:25:03 PM] Jamie: Thanks
[2016-12-15, 11:55:22 AM] Rob Feeny: You'll want to be at the airport for 5, right? How long do you think it will take to get there from your place in traffic at that time?
[2016-12-15, 11:55:43 AM] Jamie: 45 minutes?
[2016-12-15, 12:05:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I'm downtown with Morgan but I'll shoot for being at your place for 4:15.
[2016-12-15, 12:10:32 PM] Jamie: Ok cool
[2016-12-15, 5:50:22 PM] Jamie: Of course ready to go waaaaay too early
[2016-12-15, 5:50:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I'm leaving here at 3:15 to drive home then to your place
[2016-12-15, 7:09:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll be at your place at 4:20
[2016-12-15, 7:09:42 PM] Jamie:  Ok
[2016-12-15, 7:18:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Here
[2016-12-15, 7:20:45 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2016-12-16, 1:06:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Sweater acquired, book returned, keys and jacket stashed in my car
[2016-12-20, 8:30:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yo, I know you're trying to disconnect and all but Dad's worried
[2016-12-20, 8:30:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to send your accommodation details along?
[2016-12-20, 8:31:01 PM] Jamie: Haha fair enough
[2016-12-20, 8:31:15 PM] Jamie: Wifi at the hostel not very good.
[2016-12-20, 8:31:22 PM] Jamie: I will email him
[2016-12-20, 8:31:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Cool
[2016-12-24, 1:08:42 AM] Rob Feeny: When's your flight arrive on the 30th?
[2016-12-24, 2:30:36 PM] Jamie: Hey dude. Hope the drive to Kelowna was good. I come in around 9:20pm on the 30th. You cool to grab me?
‎[2016-12-24, 2:30:44 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2016-12-24, 2:38:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure just trying to sort out a date for that night
[2016-12-24, 2:38:12 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll do it early
[2016-12-24, 2:45:21 PM] Jamie: I can take a cab too. Let me know.
[2016-12-24, 2:45:24 PM] Jamie: Thanks
[2016-12-24, 2:51:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Should be fine
[2016-12-24, 2:56:29 PM] Jamie: Appreciate it
[2016-12-30, 5:54:45 PM] Jamie: Hey hey. I'm in Houston and seems like everything is on time
[2016-12-30, 5:55:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I just opened your screen shot to grab the info and check
[2016-12-30, 5:57:40 PM] Jamie: Great minds...
[2016-12-30, 5:59:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Fools?
[2016-12-31, 12:12:11 AM] Jamie: Just landed
[2016-12-31, 12:16:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok beauty. I'm sitting in the cell phone waiting area, just let me know when you have your bag.
[2016-12-31, 12:16:45 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll zip over and grab you from in front of the doors
[2016-12-31, 12:44:11 AM] Jamie: Ok got my bag. Just going to the washroom
[2016-12-31, 12:45:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'm headed your way
[2016-12-31, 12:45:56 AM] Jamie: At number 2
[2016-12-31, 12:47:16 AM] Jamie: I don't know if you can pick me up around. This is confusing
[2016-12-31, 12:47:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Well I'm just waiting to enter the international arrivals area
[2016-12-31, 12:47:55 AM] Jamie:  Ok
[2016-12-31, 12:47:57 AM] Rob Feeny: I should be able to that's why they have a cell phone waiting area
[2016-12-31, 12:49:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay yeah this isn't the greatest system. The line is barely moving.
[2016-12-31, 12:49:31 AM] Rob Feeny: But it looks like you cross and I pick you up just across the road
[2016-12-31, 12:49:45 AM] Rob Feeny: where the red and green Christmas lights are
[2016-12-31, 1:33:01 AM] Jamie: Haha looks delicious
[2016-12-31, 1:33:51 AM] Rob Feeny: it's all healthy and ship so I thought you'd like it
[2017-01-01, 1:12:55 PM] Jamie: What did you get up to for New Years?
[2017-01-01, 1:13:47 PM] Rob Feeny: I went to a keg party with some of the tiny house people
[2017-01-01, 1:13:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Feeling rather rough. How was Cypress?
[2017-01-01, 1:15:48 PM] Jamie: It was Grouse. It was tons of fun actually. We missed most of the Festiva D's because we took three hours to eat dinner at the restaurant up there and talk. Got a little sloppy at the end a little bit of drama but it was good
[2017-01-01, 1:15:59 PM] Jamie: There was a bunch of good looking women
[2017-01-01, 1:17:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha any numbers? And why drama?
[2017-01-01, 1:18:07 PM] Jamie: There was a couple that came from one of the hiking meet up spirit Matt and Melissa from the UK. He got so drunk and was flirting outrageously with a bunch of women and his girlfriend was pissed
[2017-01-01, 1:18:28 PM] Jamie: They smuggled a bottle of champagne into the dinner and by the end or like hiding underneath the table to pour it it was so obvious put hilarious
[2017-01-01, 1:18:36 PM] Jamie: Siri sucks
[2017-01-01, 1:18:52 PM] Jamie: Any stories to tell from your party?
[2017-01-01, 1:20:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha not really. Too many drugs and not enough cute single women
[2017-01-01, 1:23:07 PM] Jamie: Shitty. Young crowd?
[2017-01-01, 1:23:19 PM] Rob Feeny: I was into one but she turned out to be both a cokehead and taken
[2017-01-01, 1:23:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Late 20s
[2017-01-01, 1:23:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Early 30s
[2017-01-01, 1:23:58 PM] Rob Feeny: But the positive note was that I had a glass of wine with a lady friend before and ended up having coffee with her again this morning
[2017-01-01, 1:24:30 PM] Rob Feeny: She lived nearby, is recently single and messaging me a lot
[2017-01-01, 2:13:05 PM] Jamie: Nice!
[2017-01-04, 2:58:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Anything I don't know about going on with Morgan? Rob from WAV was really weird yesterday and asked me if I was going to "stick it out with Morgan"??
[2017-01-04, 2:59:09 PM] Jamie: Nothing I know. Maybe he's feeling around to hire you?
[2017-01-04, 3:09:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I was wondering about that. He just hired 2 new guys tho. But he was just weird in general.
[2017-01-04, 3:09:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I know Morgan is tight for money tho so I was just wondering if something was up
[2017-01-04, 3:40:06 PM] Jamie: Stress does funny things
[2017-01-04, 8:32:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Running tonight?
[2017-01-04, 8:33:51 PM] Jamie: Nope. Leg is still shot
[2017-01-04, 8:33:58 PM] Jamie: Some people are, lol
[2017-01-04, 8:35:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Naw my foot is bad, was seeing if you wanted to go for a beer
[2017-01-04, 8:35:58 PM] Jamie:  Sure
[2017-01-04, 8:36:26 PM] Jamie: Xcite?
[2017-01-04, 8:37:37 PM] Rob Feeny: That works. I can be there in about 20min how about you?
[2017-01-04, 8:37:49 PM] Jamie: Yup see ya there
[2017-01-07, 1:32:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Not sure what you're up to today but I'm having a one man party in a tiny house at West Coast Outbuildings. If you're bored come visit
[2017-01-07, 1:36:37 PM] Jamie: Haha we will see. I have a audio video proposal to do and I am switching suppliers so I have to enter almost every product new first
[2017-01-07, 1:37:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugly. Have fun with that
[2017-01-07, 1:38:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll have fun with this
[2017-01-07, 1:38:08 PM] Jamie: Yeah not my favorite thing to do.
‎[2017-01-07, 1:38:08 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-01-07, 1:38:27 PM] Jamie: Painful!
[2017-01-07, 2:56:49 PM] Jamie: You should try to sell rob Autar's HDMI cables online. I bet you could make some money facilitating it
[2017-01-07, 2:59:20 PM] Rob Feeny: He really pushing to get rid of them?
[2017-01-07, 2:59:36 PM] Jamie: Seems like. Rob always needs cash
[2017-01-07, 3:00:31 PM] Rob Feeny: What do you know about it? Morgan mentioned a container load. Know I'd they're junk or not?
[2017-01-07, 3:00:33 PM] Rob Feeny: *if
[2017-01-07, 3:01:33 PM] Jamie: Not much. I buy fairly cheap HDMI cables and they almost never fail if they make it through installation. 
[2017-01-07, 3:02:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm ok, I'll look into it.
[2017-01-07, 3:02:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Can't say I relish the thought of dealing with him, but a buck is a buck hahw
[2017-01-07, 3:03:14 PM] Jamie: And you have all the power. Obviously he is having no luck selling them.
[2017-01-07, 3:03:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck this tiny house is a cluster fuck. I just went under it for something and the whole bottom cladding is coming off. Poor girl.
[2017-01-07, 3:03:39 PM] Jamie: That's horrible
[2017-01-07, 3:04:00 PM] Jamie: My worst nightmare dealing with small/medium sized businesses
[2017-01-07, 3:04:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah and she's running out of money. Ben kind of fucked her on this one.
[2017-01-07, 3:04:40 PM] Jamie: Lame
[2017-01-07, 4:00:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Can I run 14/2 for a 1500w heater? It's only sharing with a range hood on the circuit
[2017-01-07, 4:00:44 PM] Rob Feeny: And can DC low voltage and AC run through the same hole in a 2/4 stud?
[2017-01-07, 4:00:46 PM] Jamie: In residential, hood fan is own circuit
[2017-01-07, 4:01:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Fack
[2017-01-07, 4:01:10 PM] Jamie: Is the low voltage power?
[2017-01-07, 4:01:32 PM] Jamie: Might be different code for RVs and stuff
[2017-01-07, 4:01:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. 18/2 for 12v power to a gas hot water heater for spark
[2017-01-07, 4:02:54 PM] Rob Feeny: If the code is different, is 14/2 sufficient gage? I am trying to find solutions because no wire was run for the heater and the walls are boarded mostly
[2017-01-07, 4:18:52 PM] Rob Feeny: I have a friend who's volunteering at a yoga studio and they need an electrician for a washer / dryer hookup.
[2017-01-07, 4:19:19 PM] Rob Feeny: That too small for your guys?
[2017-01-07, 4:19:35 PM] Rob Feeny: They also need a plumber, do you know if Matt does side jobs
[2017-01-07, 4:19:36 PM] Rob Feeny: ？
[2017-01-07, 4:21:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha ok, she just clarified it's a non-profit and they are looking for someone cheap. Maybe a side job for one of your guys?
[2017-01-07, 4:45:46 PM] Jamie: I will ask but I doubt it
[2017-01-07, 4:49:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Thanks man.
[2017-01-09, 2:05:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a minute for another electrical question?
[2017-01-09, 2:19:29 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2017-01-09, 6:39:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey if a wire is running through the inside of an enclosure (fridge cavity, back of cupboard) does it have to be shielded?
[2017-01-09, 6:45:13 PM] Jamie: Yes if longer than 1m I think
[2017-01-09, 6:47:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok thx
[2017-01-09, 10:31:21 PM] Rob Feeny: So West Coast will match Morgan, plus pay 50% of benefits and OT after 40hrs
[2017-01-09, 11:03:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Dear god Nikki has such an amazing ass. She's here putting out all the new displays in leggings
[2017-01-09, 11:04:38 PM] Jamie: Yes I noticed earlier. She definitely has that. 
[2017-01-09, 11:18:09 PM] Rob Feeny: What percent do your guys get for holiday pay? And is it industry standard?
[2017-01-09, 11:19:02 PM] Jamie: 4%. Yes and legally mandated I think.
[2017-01-10, 1:56:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Seeing as we're not putting 240V power into this trailer, the wire from the panel to the trailer plug should only be 3 wire, right? Load, Neutral, Ground
[2017-01-10, 1:57:06 PM] Jamie: Hmmm I have never seen a 120v 50a receptacle. 
[2017-01-10, 6:51:54 PM] Jamie: Nine hours at Starbucks today
[2017-01-10, 6:57:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Geeze man. Productive?
[2017-01-10, 6:57:45 PM] Jamie: Absolutely. All of the invoicing for December is done and out and for the first week of January
[2017-01-10, 7:03:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Sweet! That's awesome
[2017-01-11, 6:17:55 PM] Rob Feeny: So the designer on one of these tiny houses specced a #10 wire from the 50a RV plug to the panel...
[2017-01-11, 6:18:02 PM] Rob Feeny: And it's already built.
[2017-01-11, 6:21:39 PM] Jamie: Hmmmm. I don't think that's ok
[2017-01-11, 6:22:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I'm certain it's not.. #10 should be for 30amp right?
[2017-01-11, 6:25:57 PM] Rob Feeny: If you've got a minute I'd love to bounce it off you
[2017-01-11, 6:27:43 PM] Jamie: I don't have an answer for you right now Rob I'm driving I can't look it up
[2017-01-11, 6:28:08 PM] Jamie: It's possible that there is code that I don't know about for these things. Who is the designer is expected? What are they working from?
[2017-01-11, 6:28:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry man. I am pretty sure I know the answer just wantrf  to double check
[2017-01-11, 7:33:22 PM] Jamie: This is what I found.
‎[2017-01-11, 7:33:27 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2017-01-11, 7:33:55 PM] Jamie: Number 10 cannot be used for more than 30 A breaker. What's the main breaker on the panel?
[2017-01-11, 7:37:56 PM] Rob Feeny: The #10 is run from the RV plug (essentially the service in a normal house) to the panel
[2017-01-11, 7:38:31 PM] Rob Feeny: The RV plug supplies power from the landlord and is on a 50A breaker
[2017-01-11, 7:38:50 PM] Rob Feeny: I told them they need an electrician to be figuring this shit out.
[2017-01-11, 7:38:59 PM] Jamie: Is there an electrical panel in the tiny house?
[2017-01-11, 7:39:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes.
[2017-01-11, 7:40:30 PM] Jamie: What's the breaker on it?
[2017-01-11, 7:40:44 PM] Rob Feeny: There are six Breakers installed two of them 20 amp fuse for 15 amp.
[2017-01-11, 7:40:55 PM] Rob Feeny: No main breaker yet
[2017-01-11, 7:41:47 PM] Rob Feeny: We're going ahead with re-running the feed because if we limit them to 30a they can't use some things at the same time without blowing the main breaker
[2017-01-13, 7:29:47 PM] Jamie: https://www.ebmag.com/energy-power/renewables/page-6
[2017-01-13, 7:30:04 PM] Jamie: Great article on renewable advances and news
[2017-01-13, 7:30:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool thanks
[2017-01-13, 10:18:47 PM] Rob Feeny: What are you up to with your evening?
[2017-01-13, 10:19:41 PM] Jamie: Earls downtown with Morgan for dinner and then home to relax
[2017-01-13, 10:19:43 PM] Jamie: You?
[2017-01-13, 10:21:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Just finished an install for Morgan in west Vancouver and finally heading home to shower
[2017-01-13, 10:21:57 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm sure I will catch you tomorrow at archery
[2017-01-13, 10:24:35 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2017-01-14, 4:56:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Carpool to archery tag?
[2017-01-14, 4:57:08 PM] Jamie:  I'm already at Commercial and I'm leaving right from here
[2017-01-14, 4:57:34 PM] Jamie: Try Christina. I know she's picking someone up from holding
[2017-01-14, 4:57:41 PM] Jamie: Holdom *
[2017-01-14, 4:58:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'll just drive no worries
[2017-01-14, 5:51:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Just registered for the second solar course at BCIT. It covers electrical code etc which should be useful.
[2017-01-14, 5:52:00 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2017-01-14, 5:52:08 PM] Rob Feeny: I know we still need to sort out labels for the Mac residence panel and the data monitor is sitting in my place
[2017-01-14, 5:52:20 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2017-01-14, 11:40:34 PM] Jamie: Did you have fun at archery tag?
[2017-01-14, 11:40:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes it was pretty cool. It makes me want a bow.
[2017-01-14, 11:41:10 PM] Jamie: Totally
[2017-01-14, 11:44:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you have fun?
[2017-01-14, 11:44:55 PM] Rob Feeny: We should get some bows for the cabin
[2017-01-14, 11:46:59 PM] Jamie: Yeah it was fun and they're pretty great group of people. Not really a dating pool but good people
[2017-01-14, 11:47:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yes very true. Only creepy Brittany is cute
[2017-01-14, 11:47:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice folk tho
[2017-01-14, 11:47:44 PM] Jamie: Britney is just a little awkward
[2017-01-14, 11:48:27 PM] Rob Feeny: A little?
[2017-01-14, 11:49:19 PM] Jamie:  Haha I have learned how to flirt with her over the last couple of years so it's not nearly as awkward for me
[2017-01-14, 11:50:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I found it very uncomfortable to be around her
[2017-01-17, 9:42:20 AM] Jamie: Did you watch that video I sent you?
[2017-01-17, 9:43:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Not yet. Been swamped. Thinking of canceling my plans tonight to get caught up. Should have used my weekend better
[2017-01-17, 9:46:00 AM] Rob Feeny: Maybe on lunch
[2017-01-17, 9:46:28 AM] Jamie: I think you will find value from it
[2017-01-18, 8:30:20 PM] Rob Feeny: no need to call me back I was just touching base
[2017-01-18, 11:01:39 PM] Jamie: Tried to call you I guess your phone is off
[2017-01-19, 2:21:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah I was at yoga 8-10:30
‎[2017-01-19, 10:20:52 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2017-01-19, 7:45:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey do baseboard heaters have to be 240v? Trying to see if we need the 120v or 240v version of this 475w flat panel convection heater
[2017-01-19, 8:00:13 PM] Jamie: No you can order both. Same amount of watts
[2017-01-19, 8:09:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome thanks. I was pretty sure he was wrong
[2017-01-19, 8:10:08 PM] Jamie: Keep in mind the wire size has to be much bigger for the 120 V
[2017-01-19, 8:10:41 PM] Jamie: Actually just did the calculation it doesn't matter
[2017-01-19, 8:10:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep I researched and learned that, but it's only 2 @ 475w heater on a 20a circuit
[2017-01-19, 8:11:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Is the thermostat wired in line between the panel and the heater?
[2017-01-19, 8:11:32 PM] Jamie: Es
[2017-01-19, 8:11:34 PM] Jamie: Yes
[2017-01-19, 8:11:49 PM] Jamie: Or in the heater itself is common
[2017-01-19, 8:13:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, I get that, the hot wire runs to the heater location, takes a detour to the thermostat where the switching happens then back to the hot wire on the heater
[2017-01-19, 8:13:27 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2017-01-19, 8:13:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I'm figuring this shit out
[2017-01-20, 9:23:05 PM] Rob Feeny: What are you up to this eve? I'm dying to get out of the house
[2017-01-20, 9:24:21 PM] Jamie: At earls downtown with Morgan. Probably here for 1.5 hrs then heading home. Want me to text when I am heading there?  You could come here but by the time you get here we're gonna be leaving
[2017-01-20, 9:25:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Probably. You just going right home after?
[2017-01-20, 9:48:16 PM] Jamie: That was the plan
[2017-01-20, 10:05:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'm going cabin crazy ill figure something out!
[2017-01-20, 11:05:52 PM] Jamie: Just leaving downtown
[2017-01-20, 11:09:56 PM] Rob Feeny: I was hoping to get out in public but I think I'll stay in and watch a movie
[2017-01-21, 12:32:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Starbucks was really busy. Just leaving there now.
[2017-01-21, 12:33:44 PM] Jamie: No worries
[2017-01-21, 12:39:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Here
[2017-01-21, 7:15:39 PM] Jamie: Rob I have to say I'm pretty stoked for you. 35 bucks an hour is a great job
[2017-01-21, 7:22:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man. And it's cool to be using my skills
[2017-01-21, 8:09:53 PM] Jamie: Should talk to Jeff about adding technology packages. Lighting control motorized window shades heating app control etc. Very small scale like that would be an inexpensive add on
[2017-01-21, 11:18:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Know any decent bars on commercial? Grabbing a drink either a Mexican girl
[2017-01-21, 11:19:04 PM] Rob Feeny: *with a
[2017-01-21, 11:19:49 PM] Jamie: Augustine has amazing beer selection and is kind of s zoo
[2017-01-21, 11:20:14 PM] Jamie: Or falconettis has a cool upper part and usually live music downstairs
[2017-01-21, 11:20:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Just reading about it. I think I remember stopping in with you
[2017-01-21, 11:37:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks boss
[2017-01-22, 8:58:53 PM] Rob Feeny: So I bought a French press and you're right, it's a lot easier to drink the coffee without additives
[2017-01-22, 8:59:34 PM] Jamie: Nice. I do love a cup of French press
[2017-01-22, 9:02:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a small one at Canadian tire and I'll see if that will let me use less cream and honey
[2017-01-24, 11:16:45 PM] Jamie: BBQ on Friday at my house?
[2017-01-24, 11:18:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Just need to sort it out with Dean et al, I was going to go to their hotel Friday to swim and hang it etc
[2017-01-25, 12:02:03 AM] Jamie: Hey how do you order stuff from the states? Ship it to Dean and then they bring it over?
[2017-01-25, 12:02:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah or Dad and Cathy when they come across
[2017-01-25, 12:03:25 AM] Jamie: But there is a limit?
[2017-01-25, 12:04:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Yes, for. Dad and Cathy returning, I know. I'm not sure about Dean and Curtis bringing something across.
[2017-01-25, 12:04:25 AM] Rob Feeny: They've never brought me anything big
[2017-01-25, 12:05:45 AM] Jamie: Ok. I suppose I can ask them to UPS it to me too
[2017-01-25, 12:06:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Company won't ship direct?
[2017-01-25, 12:06:42 AM] Jamie: Nope. They don't sell to Canada yet
[2017-01-27, 8:46:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Just leaving work I'll be at your place pretty soon really dirty and smelly haha
[2017-02-06, 9:33:17 PM] Jamie: You working?
[2017-02-06, 9:33:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah just clocking out
[2017-02-06, 9:33:38 PM] Rob Feeny: What's up?
[2017-02-06, 9:34:07 PM] Jamie: Nothing just looking at the roads. Pretty wild out there
[2017-02-06, 9:34:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I'm not too worried. I have snow tires and chains
[2017-02-06, 9:35:57 PM] Jamie: Are you churning through the backlog at work?
[2017-02-06, 9:36:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah and just doing paperwork when nobody is here
[2017-02-06, 9:36:52 PM] Jamie: Nice
[2017-02-06, 9:38:46 PM] Rob Feeny: New manager started today so I have some backup
[2017-02-06, 9:38:57 PM] Rob Feeny: You find work for your guys yet?
[2017-02-06, 9:39:34 PM] Jamie: No. Almost nothing with the snow. But at least I can blame the weather a little bit
[2017-02-06, 9:41:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Shame.
[2017-02-06, 9:41:41 PM] Rob Feeny: So I failed to complete the project on time which sucks
[2017-02-06, 9:41:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Had to admit defeat on Sunday. No fault of my own, everything about this project is fucked
[2017-02-06, 9:42:03 PM] Rob Feeny: You eaten yet?
[2017-02-06, 9:42:11 PM] Jamie: Yeah just did
[2017-02-06, 9:42:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I'm heading home now
[2017-02-06, 9:51:43 PM] Rob Feeny: The roads aren't really that bad actually
[2017-02-06, 10:08:15 PM] Rob Feeny: okay they are way worse in North Burnaby haha
[2017-02-06, 10:16:50 PM] Jamie:  Just gonna get worse 
[2017-02-06, 10:19:19 PM] Rob Feeny: It's kind of funny to drive past all the poor stuck people with no snow tires
[2017-02-06, 10:25:48 PM] Jamie: Yeah
[2017-02-07, 1:16:14 PM] Jamie: Pocket dial
[2017-02-07, 1:16:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2017-02-08, 6:20:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey is it against code to have the electrical panel outside the house in an outside utility room?
[2017-02-08, 6:21:26 PM] Jamie: No. Although it might have to be lockable
[2017-02-08, 6:22:24 PM] Jamie: The room not the panel
[2017-02-08, 6:22:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome thanks man
[2017-02-10, 2:09:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey thanks for sending Thomas my way, he's coming on Tuesday
[2017-02-10, 2:13:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Quick question, would we want to be grounding our system to the trailer? I don't think so but Bijan was asking.
[2017-02-10, 2:16:33 PM] Jamie: No worries. He's stoked.
[2017-02-10, 2:16:41 PM] Jamie: Why would you not?
[2017-02-10, 2:36:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I don't know! I've found multiple answers to the question
[2017-02-10, 2:37:30 PM] Rob Feeny: I thought maybe it would interfere with the trailer DC system that is grounded to the trailer
[2017-02-10, 2:39:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm looks like no grounding for the ac system
[2017-02-14, 8:46:19 PM] Rob Feeny: You around your place? I have a Mercedes key I have been meaning to get back to Morgan and a shirt, think I could leave them with you?
[2017-02-14, 8:47:36 PM] Jamie: I am just leaving the pool on the North Shore I should be at my house in about half an hour
[2017-02-14, 8:48:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay I will have already passed by then no worries. I'll hang on to it for now.
[2017-02-17, 10:27:00 AM] Rob Feeny: What are you up this evening? Interested in doing something? BBQ, climbing gym?
[2017-02-17, 10:29:25 AM] Jamie: Possibly. I am going to meet Morgan on a job at 1:30. I told him I wasn't excited about trying to go in the late afternoon on a Friday to a job because he has a reputation of working until 8pm.
[2017-02-17, 10:30:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha very true. If we decided to BBQ I was going to suggest inviting him anyway
[2017-02-17, 10:30:33 AM] Rob Feeny: Haven't seen him in a whioe
[2017-02-17, 10:30:39 AM] Jamie: My shoulder is pretty bad right now so not the climbing gym but I am down for BBQ or dinner somewhere. Once I am onsite and can see the scope I will let you know.
[2017-02-17, 10:30:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2017-02-17, 11:48:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Know anything about the nest outdoor camera?
[2017-02-17, 11:49:32 AM] Jamie: Not really. The camera is great, actual outdoor is new
[2017-02-17, 11:58:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Nightmare to install unless you run all wire on the surface and plug it in outside.
[2017-02-17, 9:25:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Morgan going to keep you working all night?
[2017-02-17, 9:57:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Coleslaw complete, leaving in 3min
[2017-02-18, 6:24:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry my phone kept that reply in the outbox until now
[2017-02-18, 6:35:45 PM] Jamie: All good. Where do you wanna meet?
[2017-02-18, 6:39:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Artigiana?
[2017-02-18, 6:40:19 PM] Jamie: Sure. I'm at least 30min.
[2017-02-18, 6:41:28 PM] Rob Feeny: 430?
[2017-02-18, 6:41:35 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2017-02-20, 10:35:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Aaaaand of course Thomas forgot his jacket at my work
[2017-02-20, 10:35:21 PM] Jamie: Haha dumb kid
[2017-02-20, 10:35:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Good attitude though, he was great today
[2017-02-20, 10:36:20 PM] Jamie: Yeah Thomas is a great asset to the company. And a nice guy.
[2017-02-20, 10:53:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Mind if I drop it at your place as I go by?
[2017-02-20, 10:54:37 PM] Jamie: ETA? I'm at Starbucks but heading home soon
[2017-02-20, 10:55:26 PM] Rob Feeny: 20 minutes?
[2017-02-20, 10:55:35 PM] Jamie: I will be at Starbucks
[2017-02-20, 10:55:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Otherwise I plan to be at Starbucks in about 30 minutes
[2017-02-21, 12:26:28 PM] Jamie: Hey can you put me in touch with the guys teaching your solar course at BCIT?
[2017-02-21, 12:28:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. I have class on Friday, want me to talk to him? Or just send you his contact info?
[2017-02-21, 12:29:49 PM] Jamie: Both would be great. I want to put all my guys in the course the next time it is offered. 5 people. Thanks!
[2017-02-21, 12:29:59 PM] Rob Feeny: http://viridianenergy.ca/
[2017-02-21, 12:33:15 PM] Jamie: Thanks!
[2017-02-21, 12:34:14 PM] Rob Feeny: The instructor is Eric Smiley
[2017-02-21, 12:34:25 PM] Jamie: Ok I will contact him.
[2017-02-21, 2:51:39 PM] Jamie: Is your company registered with WCB?
[2017-02-21, 2:52:26 PM] Jamie: As in you paid them on your 'payroll' for your business last year? Trying to find out if I have to pay your premiums or if you paid them
[2017-02-21, 2:54:44 PM] Rob Feeny: No, I work under the WCB of whomever I contract to. I am a sole proprietor, not an incorporated company
[2017-02-21, 2:54:51 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2017-02-21, 2:54:52 PM] Rob Feeny: You'll have to pay them
[2017-02-25, 12:40:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah this course would be great for your guys, it covers all the electrical code relevant to renewable energy and labeling etc
[2017-02-25, 12:40:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Including parts of the code that are incorrect and can be ignored.. Seeing as Eric Smiley helped write the code. Haha
[2017-02-25, 12:41:25 PM] Jamie: That's sweet. I really want to do it now
[2017-02-25, 12:42:19 PM] Rob Feeny: This second half is honestly too technical for me, mostly code and overcurrent protection etc
[2017-02-25, 12:46:10 PM] Jamie: When is the next course? Do you know?
[2017-02-25, 12:52:25 PM] Rob Feeny: It's not listed on the BCIT site but I'll ask
[2017-02-25, 12:57:14 PM] Jamie: Thanks
[2017-02-25, 12:59:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Found it on the site , email sent
[2017-02-27, 10:19:15 PM] Jamie: My new assistant quit after 1 day.
[2017-02-27, 10:33:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow. What happened?
[2017-02-27, 10:37:05 PM] Jamie: Not sure. Seemed like everything went well and then she texted me an hour ago and pulled be plug. Says she wants a more structured office environment.
[2017-02-27, 11:20:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. Tough. Took a while to find her?
[2017-02-27, 11:21:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Was she going to be working out of your home office or from home?
[2017-02-27, 11:23:15 PM] Jamie: 2 months, $270 and about 10 hours of my time including today. Expensive each time I try
[2017-02-27, 11:24:53 PM] Jamie: 1 day a week from my place to start. Once there is a system for dealing with the mail and filing, it could be as little as a couple hours a week there.
[2017-02-27, 11:26:25 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm sorry to hear it, Jamie
[2017-02-27, 11:27:24 PM] Jamie: Thanks. We are doing the swap to QuickBooks online tomorrow too. Haha or I guess I am
[2017-02-27, 11:30:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe her feedback can help you rewrite the ad to find someone more suited
[2017-02-27, 11:31:43 PM] Jamie: Just did. Clarified that it is based out of a home office and there will be some work there
[2017-02-27, 11:39:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm you need some semi retired old lady
[2017-02-27, 11:43:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Except they don't tend to be good with technology.. M
[2017-03-02, 12:23:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey I'm trying to source a very slim LED light like the ones in the pic that's rated for wet areas (above a shower). Know any suppliers? Our supplier only has one that's 2" thick
‎[2017-03-02, 12:23:24 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-03-02, 12:54:48 PM] Jamie: Linear or round
[2017-03-02, 12:54:51 PM] Jamie: ?
[2017-03-02, 12:56:31 PM] Jamie: http://www.standardpro.com/featured-product/low-profile-downlight-lpdl/
[2017-03-02, 12:58:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Either, but the entire unit needs to be flat as the ceiling is solid wood. The transformer is located elsewhere and LV wire run there
[2017-03-02, 12:59:05 PM] Rob Feeny: We actually are using basically that product as our pot lights, they're awesome
[2017-03-02, 12:59:53 PM] Jamie: https://lightsandparts.com/product/5w-led-ultrathin-cabinet-light-square-surface-mounted-2/
[2017-03-02, 1:00:58 PM] Jamie: You may have to call them. The website doesn't seem to download the specs. They are fantastic to deal with and their product has been good so far
[2017-03-02, 1:03:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome thanks. We're using Source LED and he's good but has limited selection. Appreciated.
[2017-03-02, 1:22:11 PM] Jamie: Np
[2017-03-03, 10:42:46 PM] Jamie: Interested in hanging out this weekend and talking about building awesome tiny houses?
[2017-03-04, 12:41:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Sure man, I'm busy all day tomorrow with a conference, but free Sunday, how about you?
[2017-03-04, 10:40:54 AM] Rob Feeny: I replied to this when I was very distracted last night. Not sure if this is sarcasm or not. You ok?
[2017-03-04, 10:41:48 AM] Jamie: Not sarcasm. Was reading about tiny houses
[2017-03-04, 10:43:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok. Honestly the tiny houses I build need someone like you doing the systems vetting, planning is huge
[2017-03-04, 10:56:14 PM] Jamie: Well that was an incredible waste of time. Drove all the way to lucky taco in kitsilano to meet Matt, Sally and the gang and there was no parking anywhere within a 15 block radius. Tried for half an hour and then I turned around went home
[2017-03-04, 11:01:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow. That sucks.
[2017-03-04, 11:01:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Should have just taken the ticket and parked illegally
[2017-03-04, 11:02:04 PM] Jamie: Yeah. No taco is worth 35 bucks
[2017-03-04, 11:02:59 PM] Jamie: Had I known it was the most difficult parking in Vancouver I never would've left my house or I would've found another method of transportation other than my truck. 30 minutes of U-turns trying to find one of 20 spaces smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood with six other vehicles competing with me is incredibly stressful.
[2017-03-04, 11:03:22 PM] Jamie: And the other drivers were totally stressed out and honking and backing up and it was a war, ha ha
[2017-03-04, 11:11:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow
[2017-03-04, 11:11:29 PM] Rob Feeny: So glad I took the bus today
[2017-03-04, 11:11:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Which of course was late and I did my stress in advance
[2017-03-04, 11:12:04 PM] Jamie: Haha at least you got it out of the way
[2017-03-05, 12:01:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Saw Matt last night at the Ukrainian dinner actually
[2017-03-05, 12:02:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Now I'm at steamworks with renewable energy types
[2017-03-05, 12:02:10 AM] Jamie: Nice
[2017-03-07, 11:09:53 PM] Rob Feeny: If Tofino doesn't work out, interested in going to the Rugby Sevens with Nelson and I? He has tickets
[2017-03-07, 11:10:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Saturday
[2017-03-07, 11:10:17 PM] Jamie: This weekend?
[2017-03-07, 11:10:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes
[2017-03-07, 11:11:02 PM] Jamie: Yeah we postponed the surfing
[2017-03-07, 11:12:27 PM] Jamie: When is it?
[2017-03-07, 11:13:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Saturday mostly all day. But I'm learning that it's a drinking-heavy event. He's got tickets up for grabs for half price, $50
[2017-03-07, 11:14:20 PM] Jamie: I appreciate the invite but I think I'll pass. I'm down for a beer or something another time in the next bit
[2017-03-07, 11:14:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sounds good
[2017-03-07, 11:19:33 PM] Jamie: Friday?
[2017-03-08, 1:12:19 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm doing dinner with Ashley Yip on Friday. I can do tomorrow or Thursday after 7...
[2017-03-08, 1:29:51 AM] Jamie: I have running tomorrow and Laura is in town on Thursday
[2017-03-08, 1:58:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahh ok
[2017-03-10, 7:53:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow they ticketed all the cars parked outside your place
[2017-03-10, 7:53:57 PM] Jamie: Whaaaaaaa? I have never seen that must been somebody new
[2017-03-10, 7:58:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah there are probably cars with tickets
[2017-03-10, 8:27:30 PM] Jamie: Did you get one?
[2017-03-10, 8:31:21 PM] Rob Feeny: No, I just parked at  and hopped a bus downtown
[2017-03-14, 12:19:10 PM] Jamie: This is taking longer that I thought
[2017-03-14, 12:19:39 PM] Rob Feeny: You can check you nunber on their site, while sitting in Starbucks
[2017-03-14, 12:20:04 PM] Jamie: Yeah I was only 2 numbers away but they are slooooooow
[2017-03-14, 12:20:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Technically, I think even if you aren't there they can't skip you
[2017-03-14, 12:20:40 PM] Rob Feeny: So if you come back, they out you right in
[2017-03-14, 7:12:05 PM] Jamie: Do you feel better after taking a part day off?
[2017-03-14, 7:12:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope. Already almost walked out.
[2017-03-14, 7:13:04 PM] Jamie: Well I feel for you man. I know you're suffering like I am
[2017-03-14, 7:13:49 PM] Rob Feeny: I kind of wish I was oblivious enough to just do some shitty job and not care
[2017-03-14, 7:15:14 PM] Rob Feeny: The only thing I seem to be good at in this life is quitting.
[2017-03-14, 7:15:15 PM] Jamie: Or somehow reframe it also it doesn't matter. Like Morgan. He is convinced himself that he does exactly what he wants to do different and therefore he's happy
[2017-03-14, 7:21:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm just tired of being forced to do a shitty job
[2017-03-14, 7:24:02 PM] Jamie: Can you pass the quality control back to Jeff? You organize and initiate and then he's responsible for quality control?
[2017-03-14, 7:24:32 PM] Rob Feeny: No, Geoff isn't even in the shop, he's entirely in the office, when he's on site
[2017-03-14, 7:24:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I simply don't have the money, time or skilled people to do it right
[2017-03-14, 7:26:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Things not getting any better for you?
[2017-03-14, 7:34:11 PM] Jamie: Gradually slide into bankruptcy, lol
[2017-03-14, 7:34:56 PM] Rob Feeny: You're gradually sliding into bankruptcy? Or me?
[2017-03-14, 7:35:00 PM] Jamie: It would be easier if it just happened. But this could drag out for months, just barely paying my wholesalers/taxes
[2017-03-14, 7:35:14 PM] Jamie: My company, followed very quickly by my
[2017-03-14, 7:35:21 PM] Jamie: me*
[2017-03-14, 7:35:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow man.
[2017-03-14, 7:35:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Can't you get the guys just doing mindless electrical contracting, just to make cash?
[2017-03-14, 7:37:35 PM] Jamie: That's what we are doing. It's been slow for 2.5 months.
[2017-03-14, 7:38:01 PM] Jamie: Any profit made last year has been eaten by keeping the guys busy and pay the bills.
[2017-03-14, 7:38:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Is the whole industry slow?
[2017-03-14, 7:38:43 PM] Jamie: I'm pretty much, to use a poker analogy, 'all in'
[2017-03-14, 7:39:02 PM] Jamie: Yes
[2017-03-14, 7:39:27 PM] Rob Feeny: I guess the government efforts to reign in the crazy real estate market are taking effect
[2017-03-14, 7:40:09 PM] Jamie: But coming off of a tough summer, followed by 2 big jobs where I had to negotiate some of my profit away and then a prolonged slow period is tough.
[2017-03-14, 7:40:49 PM] Jamie: And the worst part is I don't care
[2017-03-14, 7:42:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh I know that feeling
[2017-03-14, 7:42:24 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm taking pills to make myself work right now
[2017-03-14, 7:42:41 PM] Rob Feeny: But really I want to crawl back in bed
[2017-03-14, 7:42:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Anything in particular triggering the apathy?
[2017-03-14, 7:44:50 PM] Jamie: Yeah they wouldn't give me pills last time I went
[2017-03-14, 7:45:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Tranqs?
[2017-03-14, 7:45:41 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm taking Modnafil to keep myself motivated
[2017-03-14, 7:47:31 PM] Jamie: Just a gradual realization that no matter how hard I work, when it gets to the point that I have to count on other people, the costs compound faster than the benefits. Be it financial or emotional
[2017-03-14, 7:50:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha you sound like the perfect candidate for an AI personal assistant
[2017-03-14, 7:52:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Wish I had something to say in regards to that. Honestly I'm one of the ones that can't be depended on and that's part of my own person downward spiral
[2017-03-14, 7:52:50 PM] Rob Feeny: *personal
[2017-03-14, 7:53:48 PM] Jamie: It's everybody man. Everyone is overworked and promising things they can't hope to offer. It's marketing out of control
[2017-03-14, 8:11:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Makes you want to run away into the woods
[2017-03-14, 8:12:10 PM] Jamie: Yup. I totally get the guys in the states that are on piece of property and they just want everyone to go away. Opt out of society
[2017-03-14, 8:43:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey do you have a Hi-Pot tester?
[2017-03-14, 8:43:42 PM] Jamie: Nope
[2017-03-14, 8:43:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok thx
[2017-03-14, 8:45:59 PM] Rob Feeny: You eaten yet?
[2017-03-14, 8:46:21 PM] Jamie: Nope.  Getting hungry
[2017-03-14, 8:49:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Got anything in mind? Just finishing eork
[2017-03-14, 8:51:19 PM] Rob Feeny: I had Pho last night
[2017-03-14, 8:52:03 PM] Jamie: I'm easy. I would be happy with white spot
[2017-03-14, 8:58:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Google says 20min
[2017-03-14, 9:13:31 PM] Rob Feeny: You in Starbucks?
[2017-03-14, 9:13:52 PM] Jamie: Yup. Just finishing cassidys break
[2017-03-17, 9:09:52 AM] Jamie: Hope you have a better day today man
[2017-03-17, 9:11:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Thanks Jamie
[2017-03-17, 5:41:54 PM] Jamie: Did you survive?
[2017-03-17, 5:42:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Only walked out once!
[2017-03-17, 8:28:46 PM] Jamie: What are you doing tonight?
[2017-03-17, 8:29:11 PM] Rob Feeny: No clue. Was contemplating either the gym or drink wine at Stoya's haha
[2017-03-17, 8:30:13 PM] Jamie: Yeah I'm bored. Want to hit xcite grill or something?
[2017-03-17, 8:30:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure I just drove past. Gimme 20 to change
[2017-03-17, 8:31:01 PM] Jamie: Ok sounds good
[2017-03-17, 8:31:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Should we invite Dan?
[2017-03-17, 8:32:14 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2017-03-17, 8:35:10 PM] Rob Feeny: K he's joining
[2017-03-17, 8:45:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Dan's just extracting himself from the kids. We'll be leave in a couple min
[2017-03-17, 8:45:23 PM] Jamie: Ok no problem. Leaving in 5
[2017-03-17, 8:48:59 PM] Jamie: No guarantees but Morgan might come
[2017-03-17, 8:53:20 PM] Rob Feeny: On our way
[2017-03-19, 9:43:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man this son is doing wonders for my spirits!
[2017-03-19, 11:30:23 PM] Jamie: Yeah me too
[2017-03-22, 8:00:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey is it OK to have exposed loomex in a utility closet for 6"? They should have used  bx, I knoe
[2017-03-22, 8:00:40 PM] Rob Feeny: *know
[2017-03-22, 9:18:23 PM] Jamie: Yeah I think you get 1 foot
[2017-03-22, 9:19:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok beauty that works perfectly
[2017-03-22, 9:24:48 PM] Jamie: You can also get flex - armoured casing. Like bx with no wires inside
[2017-03-22, 9:26:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok ok. That was what Jesse suggested, stripping some casing from BX but it sounded sketchy..
[2017-03-22, 9:55:30 PM] Jamie: You can buy it empty as well
[2017-03-22, 9:56:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool that might work. I'm at gescan in the am. We delivered 2 units last week and have another one going out Saturday. Shit's happening!
[2017-03-22, 9:59:07 PM] Jamie: That's awesome!
[2017-03-22, 10:00:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Every single one of them way late, but still done.

[2017-03-23, 5:26:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Sharp hey? This one is turning out well
[2017-03-24, 12:32:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Where do you get your panel warning labels made?
[2017-03-24, 12:34:40 PM] Jamie: Permel Engraving Ltd

3725 2nd Ave, Burnaby, BC V5C 3W6
(604) 430-5504

https://www.google.ca/search?client=safari
[2017-03-24, 12:35:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome thanks. Do you do vinyl ones or engraved plastic labels?
[2017-03-24, 12:35:38 PM] Jamie: Lamacoids, I think they are called. Industry standard.
[2017-03-24, 12:35:44 PM] Jamie: Engraved plastic.
[2017-03-24, 12:35:50 PM] Jamie: Craig is very reasonable
[2017-03-24, 12:35:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, that's what I was thinking. Thanks.
[2017-03-24, 10:03:59 PM] Rob Feeny: You busy?
[2017-03-28, 8:41:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugh. Finding a new roommate sucks.
[2017-03-28, 8:54:47 PM] Jamie: No luck?
[2017-03-28, 8:56:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope. Had some 45yr old guy in a land rover look at it yesterday. And about 3 people call (ad says email) and ask questions that are clearly answered in the ad. I hung up on one of them.
[2017-03-30, 11:58:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Flight booked, money sent. Thanks.
[2017-03-30, 7:36:27 PM] Jamie: Got plans for dinner? I was thinking Vietnamese
[2017-03-30, 7:47:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry was napping. I'm actually heading downtown to an InterNations event at 7, leaving at 6:16
[2017-03-30, 7:47:29 PM] Rob Feeny: *:15
[2017-03-30, 7:47:39 PM] Jamie: OK no worries
‎[2017-03-31, 10:54:07 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-03-31, 10:54:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Chinese people are fucking weird
[2017-03-31, 10:57:21 AM] Jamie: Is she actually crawling?
[2017-03-31, 10:57:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2017-03-31, 10:58:18 AM] Rob Feeny: With knee pads
[2017-03-31, 9:26:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Chatted up this cute Asian girl for 30min until she mentioned her church and then the MLM business she's super into...
[2017-03-31, 9:26:51 PM] Jamie: Haha
[2017-03-31, 9:35:21 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm not getting that time back!
[2017-03-31, 9:36:04 PM] Jamie: Hopefully not in person
[2017-03-31, 9:38:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup it was in Starbucks
[2017-03-31, 9:38:28 PM] Jamie: Haha. How old?
[2017-03-31, 9:38:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Mid 20s. Been graduated and working 4 years
[2017-04-01, 5:05:04 PM] Jamie: Morgan wants me to come down early and help him prepare. Probably going to head down just after 5
[2017-04-01, 5:15:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Gimme a sec to look at transit
[2017-04-01, 5:28:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok just take off without me. I'll either hitch a ride with Dan or transit down
[2017-04-06, 10:29:04 PM] Jamie: What's your day like tomorrow or Sat? Could totally use your help for some party ideas / prep...
[2017-04-06, 10:43:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Tomorrow is a clusterfuck. Yet another totally late building going out Saturday morning. I could do Sat afternoon
[2017-04-06, 10:49:08 PM] Jamie: Sure. Don't sweat too much about it. I have some of the guys getting the place set up. Just figured making jello shooters together would fun 🍺
[2017-04-06, 10:51:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yep I'd enjoy it. Wish I could bail on work. I don't want to do this regularly
[2017-04-07, 2:30:23 PM] Jamie: Did we have to steal the shooter cups last time?
[2017-04-07, 2:54:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I stole them but they sell small amounts of them at the dollar store by your house
[2017-04-07, 2:58:11 PM] Jamie: Ok awesome
[2017-04-07, 2:58:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Or at least they did last time I looked.
[2017-04-07, 2:58:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Just had to tell a guy his cheque wasn't ready after he drove here from white Rock
[2017-04-07, 3:01:00 PM] Jamie: Oh crappy
[2017-04-07, 9:10:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Well we blew another deadline. Whee. At least I won't be working til midnight tonight.
[2017-04-07, 9:10:50 PM] Jamie: The client left?
[2017-04-07, 9:12:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope she's sticking around til Wednesday now
[2017-04-07, 9:14:11 PM] Jamie: Oh shit. So the pressure stays on
[2017-04-07, 9:21:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Need any party prep help?
[2017-04-07, 9:22:07 PM] Jamie: Nope. All done. But if you want to swing by for a beer you are welcome.
[2017-04-07, 9:22:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sounds good to
[2017-04-08, 1:26:44 PM] Jamie: Haha apparently there is a company that sells gold coins imprinted with a QR code of your cold storage bitcoin wallet. I guess that's a way of hedging your bets...
[2017-04-08, 4:26:11 PM] Rob Feeny: But if someone steals it they get both...
[2017-04-08, 4:26:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry that came in when I was at the gym. Had an amazing yoga class then workout
[2017-04-08, 5:16:36 PM] Jamie: Hey any chance you could bring ice and disposable cups when you come?
[2017-04-08, 5:16:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure no problem
[2017-04-08, 5:16:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm bringing a salad too
[2017-04-08, 5:17:05 PM] Jamie: Cool. Thx
‎[2017-04-08, 5:53:15 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2017-04-08, 6:27:31 PM] Jamie: Do you figure you'll come by around five? I could use your help getting the cover on the shelter
[2017-04-08, 7:50:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn sorry, I was at Stoya's and it seems I had no Internet?
[2017-04-08, 7:51:08 PM] Rob Feeny: I fixed their fence and then got caught up chatting and fixing things at her place
[2017-04-08, 7:51:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Getting ready to go now
[2017-04-11, 10:42:29 PM] Rob Feeny: I just flirted outrageously with something girl at Mark's Work Wearhouse who was selling meet new work boots until I figured out that she was 17
[2017-04-11, 10:42:55 PM] Rob Feeny: still the most fun I've had buying work boots ever
[2017-04-11, 10:51:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow terrible voice to text. Anyhow. Hilarious girl. Not that cute, looked like she was mid 20s. Seriously the most fun flirting I've had in months and then bam
[2017-04-11, 10:55:22 PM] Jamie: Haha nice!
[2017-04-11, 10:56:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I got her in trouble with her manager. Whoops.
[2017-04-13, 3:59:43 PM] Jamie: Hey beer tonight?
[2017-04-13, 4:15:27 PM] Rob Feeny: What time are you thinking? Trying to fit in a yoga class too
[2017-04-13, 4:16:15 PM] Jamie: Doesn't matter. If it gets too late, I generally fall asleep, lol
[2017-04-13, 4:16:24 PM] Jamie: What time is yoga?
[2017-04-13, 4:16:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha and what's too late? 8pm?
[2017-04-13, 4:18:35 PM] Jamie: Could probably do 8
[2017-04-13, 4:26:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks like the class I want is 5:30 to 6:30 today. How about 7?
[2017-04-13, 4:34:43 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2017-04-13, 4:34:48 PM] Jamie: You pick the place
[2017-04-13, 4:35:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Toss-up between Cotto and SteamWorks.
[2017-04-13, 4:39:09 PM] Jamie: I feel like steamworks would be like 5 guys on barstools and one crusty server, haha. But that's just my imagination. Have you been?
[2017-04-13, 4:40:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope not yet. X-site is right by Moksha but the girls there are getting sloppier by the day
[2017-04-13, 4:40:29 PM] Jamie: True
[2017-04-13, 4:45:06 PM] Rob Feeny: So Ben, the guy who had my job before me, called and tried to poach me for a company he's starting
[2017-04-13, 4:46:11 PM] Jamie: Well I would just take that as a complement and say maybe later, lol
[2017-04-13, 5:29:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I Yes I said I'd be up for a weekend gig or two
[2017-04-13, 5:51:19 PM] Rob Feeny: What happens when an employee is on overtime on a stat holiday? Looks like I have to work tomorrow
[2017-04-13, 5:51:40 PM] Jamie: 2.5 x pay
[2017-04-13, 5:51:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow
[2017-04-13, 5:52:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Plus your paid day off?
[2017-04-13, 5:52:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd already be getting paid for tomorrow if I didn't work it. Plus if it wasn't a stat I'd be getting 1.5
[2017-04-13, 5:52:50 PM] Jamie: No. 1.5 x for overtime plus reg pay for 8hrs
[2017-04-13, 5:53:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, I thought you got paid 1.5x for working on a stat
[2017-04-13, 6:02:01 PM] Jamie: Nope. Reg time
[2017-04-13, 6:02:41 PM] Jamie: Double time for stat because you get paid for the stat (8hrs) plus reg time for each hr worked
[2017-04-13, 6:03:04 PM] Jamie: I can't even comprehend what double overtime on a  stat must cost
[2017-04-13, 6:03:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm government site says 1.5x
[2017-04-13, 6:03:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Because you have to work on what should be a holiday
[2017-04-13, 6:03:51 PM] Jamie: Hmmm ok I don't know.
[2017-04-13, 6:05:07 PM] Jamie: time-and-a-half for the first 12 hours worked and double-time for any work over 12 hours; plus an average day’s pay.
[2017-04-13, 6:06:06 PM] Jamie: http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/factsheets/statutory-holidays-in-british-columbia
[2017-04-13, 6:12:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I just called them. The two 1.5x multipliers don't add up
[2017-04-13, 6:12:21 PM] Jamie: So...
[2017-04-13, 6:12:24 PM] Rob Feeny: So there's no added compensation for working a stat in this case
[2017-04-13, 6:12:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Unlike there would be if I wasn't in OT
[2017-04-13, 6:12:37 PM] Jamie: Right
[2017-04-13, 6:37:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Client just dropped that he's on a 30 single phase service not a 50A two phase like he said originally.
[2017-04-13, 6:38:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Whoops. He's got 65ish amps of loads if it's all running at once
[2017-04-13, 6:38:46 PM] Jamie: Lame. Interconnect breakers?
[2017-04-13, 6:39:05 PM] Jamie: Have you seen those? Some breakers can't be on if another one is on
[2017-04-13, 6:40:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm cool idea. Except his panel is in an exterior utility room
[2017-04-13, 6:41:07 PM] Rob Feeny: He's the guy with 3 TVs in his unit
[2017-04-13, 6:41:22 PM] Jamie: Doesn't matter to you, really
[2017-04-13, 6:42:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I was just going to type that. Ultimately it's his problem not ours
[2017-04-13, 9:06:09 PM] Rob Feeny: There in 5
[2017-04-13, 9:06:47 PM] Jamie: Where we heading? Cotto?
[2017-04-13, 9:06:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Yp
[2017-04-13, 9:06:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2017-04-13, 9:06:59 PM] Rob Feeny: If that's cool
[2017-04-13, 9:07:08 PM] Jamie: Sounds good just leaving my place
[2017-04-13, 9:07:31 PM] Rob Feeny: K
[2017-04-14, 8:13:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Well something big went down on the other side of boundary from your place. There are 10 police cars involved
[2017-04-14, 8:15:15 PM] Jamie: That's the marijuana dispensary
[2017-04-14, 8:15:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Did they rated?
[2017-04-14, 8:16:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Read it
[2017-04-15, 10:38:52 AM] Rob Feeny: In honor of you
‎[2017-04-15, 10:39:22 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-04-15, 10:39:51 AM] Jamie: Haha nice! I am really enjoying my shakes these days
[2017-04-15, 10:40:05 AM] Jamie: Are use the slow cooker to cook a whole bunch of beef and I cooked up bunch of cubed salsa chicken
[2017-04-15, 10:40:15 AM] Jamie: I used*
[2017-04-15, 10:40:28 AM] Jamie: So my shakes are all my fruits and vegetables and then my meat is cooked separately
[2017-04-15, 10:42:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice
[2017-04-15, 10:42:57 AM] Rob Feeny: I need a better blender, this thing is rather gritty
[2017-04-15, 10:44:31 AM] Jamie: I have seen the magic bullet as cheap as 30 bucks at Canadian tire
[2017-04-15, 10:45:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm tempting. I just have issues using a "magic bullet" for my food...
[2017-04-15, 5:35:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey let me know next time you're going to Costco. I hear that they have the travel mugs I'm looking for
[2017-04-15, 5:41:38 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2017-04-15, 11:15:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow, that police incident near your place was a robbery at the dispensary and someone got slashed with a machete
[2017-04-15, 11:16:43 PM] Jamie: Crazy weed fiends!
[2017-04-16, 11:16:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Going to do a short run up Burnaby Mountain then an 11:30 yoga class if you're interested in joining for any of it
[2017-04-16, 11:17:52 AM] Jamie: Thanks for the invite, just rolling out of bed and I am going swimming this afternoon.
[2017-04-16, 11:18:24 AM] Rob Feeny: I tried to sleep in. Made it to 7am
[2017-04-16, 11:19:09 AM] Jamie: Yeah it's definitely tough to stay in bed, lol. I had to put extra effort and
[2017-04-16, 11:19:13 AM] Jamie: In*
[2017-04-16, 11:26:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Hard life. But man, 3 days of going to sleep without an alarm set in the am is a special treat
[2017-04-16, 11:26:43 AM] Jamie: Oh yeah. Sure is
[2017-04-16, 11:52:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Did I lend you my running pack?
[2017-04-16, 11:54:46 AM] Jamie: Don't think so
[2017-04-16, 11:57:28 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmm damn
[2017-04-16, 11:58:06 AM] Jamie: Just checked my closet. I remember talking about it but I don't have it. I usually return things immediately
[2017-04-16, 12:00:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok maybe it was Dan
[2017-04-17, 6:24:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you work with Crestron?
[2017-04-17, 6:26:06 PM] Jamie: No. But I have a guy
[2017-04-17, 6:27:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok can I put someone in contact with you?
[2017-04-17, 6:27:12 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2017-04-20, 8:07:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey do all external receptacles have to be GFi or just the first one in the circuit
[2017-04-20, 8:08:13 PM] Jamie: First one in the circuit. Multiple GFI's on a single circuit cause lots of problems
[2017-04-20, 8:37:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome thanks
[2017-04-20, 11:54:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Well I stopped at McDonald's on my way home and it was packed with stoned kids
[2017-04-20, 11:54:32 PM] Jamie: Naturally. And ice cream cone for you?
[2017-04-20, 11:54:49 PM] Rob Feeny: of course because I'm a fat kid
[2017-04-20, 11:55:22 PM] Rob Feeny: I woke up did an hour of yoga and then work for 14 hours I figure I deserve it
[2017-04-20, 11:56:25 PM] Jamie: Fair enough
[2017-04-20, 11:57:00 PM] Rob Feeny: But we're getting better! I had the CSA certification finished almost 48 hours before the delivery!
[2017-04-20, 11:57:17 PM] Jamie: And you passed?
[2017-04-20, 11:57:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2017-04-20, 11:57:56 PM] Jamie: Nice 👍
[2017-04-20, 11:58:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Ready for Tofino?
[2017-04-21, 12:00:48 AM] Jamie: Close. I need a portable burner stove like Andrews, another shelter and a tarp. I have everything else.
[2017-04-21, 12:00:54 AM] Jamie: Sure don't like that I can't make a reservation
[2017-04-21, 12:10:46 AM] Rob Feeny: For the campsite?
[2017-04-21, 12:11:00 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2017-04-21, 12:11:08 AM] Rob Feeny: I have a backpacking stove if you need one
[2017-04-21, 12:11:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmm that's interesting. Surprising
[2017-04-21, 12:12:22 AM] Jamie: I think I want to buy one but will see if I have the money this week. Thanks though. Did you find your running back pack?
[2017-04-21, 12:12:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope still not sure where it is. Maybe I lent it to Genny
[2017-04-22, 12:02:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Well another deadline blown. But I now have the weekend off and was making $70 an hour for the last 4 hours
[2017-04-22, 12:14:34 AM] Jamie: Nice!
[2017-04-22, 12:15:36 AM] Rob Feeny: I got 3 Grand after taxes today for payday it was pretty nice
[2017-04-22, 12:16:12 AM] Jamie: That's a good check
[2017-04-22, 12:23:19 AM] Rob Feeny: What did you get up to on your Friday?
[2017-04-22, 12:24:08 AM] Jamie: Country concert with Paul in Abbotsford
[2017-04-22, 12:31:01 AM] Rob Feeny: Sounds fun
[2017-04-22, 12:58:34 AM] Jamie: Oh yeah. Hot young chicks everywhere
[2017-04-22, 8:28:35 PM] Rob Feeny: So did you go to Tofino?
[2017-04-22, 8:29:47 PM] Jamie: Next weekend
[2017-04-22, 8:33:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh I was confused
[2017-04-22, 8:34:03 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2017-04-22, 8:34:42 PM] Jamie: Any chance I can borrow a tent and sleeping bag for Malika? Matt is supposed to supply but he's kind of flighty
[2017-04-22, 8:36:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure. Got both
[2017-04-22, 8:36:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Does she need a sleeping pad?
[2017-04-22, 8:36:35 PM] Jamie: Probably
[2017-04-22, 8:37:06 PM] Jamie: Maybe I will just let Matt know that we've got it covered so that I can at least ensure that that happens
[2017-04-22, 8:38:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure, it's a big roomy tent and I just waterproofed it.
[2017-04-22, 8:38:22 PM] Rob Feeny: You sleeping in the taco?
[2017-04-22, 9:13:53 PM] Jamie: I think the taco will be parked far away from the campsites so probably not
[2017-04-23, 2:03:04 PM] Jamie: What are you gonna do for your birthday?
[2017-04-23, 2:03:16 PM] Rob Feeny: No clue at this point
[2017-04-23, 2:03:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe camping, maybe Kelowna?
[2017-04-23, 2:03:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe a BBQ?
[2017-04-23, 2:04:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Could be an incentive to finally finish my living room
[2017-04-23, 2:04:11 PM] Jamie: Better book it soon before everybody plans their May long  weekend
[2017-04-23, 2:04:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I know :S
[2017-04-23, 2:04:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe nothing
[2017-04-23, 2:04:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Tempting to run away to Mexico for 5 days
[2017-04-23, 2:05:08 PM] Jamie: Tell me about it
[2017-04-23, 2:06:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Saw a flight for 421$ to Cancun
[2017-04-23, 2:08:00 PM] Rob Feeny: You at Starbucks?
[2017-04-23, 2:08:41 PM] Jamie: Nope just left
[2017-04-23, 2:09:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Heading there to read
[2017-04-24, 4:40:23 PM] Jamie: Any chance you ended up with my nesting pots and pan kit from the last time we went camping?
[2017-04-24, 5:03:55 PM] Rob Feeny: No. I just have my own. I reorganized it all recently.
[2017-04-24, 5:04:31 PM] Jamie: I think I may have borrowed Kats last time actually
[2017-04-24, 5:17:35 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm in my car having an anxiety attack about how much work we have starting right now
[2017-04-24, 5:25:49 PM] Jamie: Actually?
[2017-04-24, 5:26:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. Not sure how long I'm going to last here. I don't want to work in construction.
[2017-04-24, 5:27:57 PM] Jamie: That must be frustrating
[2017-04-24, 5:29:08 PM] Rob Feeny: It's more than I can handle. We'll have 5 buildings in production, none of which I am ready for
[2017-04-24, 5:30:22 PM] Jamie: Is each one getting better?
[2017-04-24, 5:30:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Somewhat. But every one is getting bigger and more complex
[2017-04-24, 5:31:11 PM] Rob Feeny: They're not even tiny houses, which is what I came here to build
[2017-04-24, 5:33:37 PM] Jamie: I know you hate it but it's an amazing opportunity (if you survive) to cram many years of learning into a few. But very high stress
[2017-04-24, 7:02:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Very high stress. I'll probably be ok tomorrow.
[2017-04-24, 7:59:10 PM] Jamie: Beer?
[2017-04-24, 8:00:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure. Was going to go to a networking event but not feeling it.
[2017-04-24, 8:01:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Just gotta change
[2017-04-24, 8:01:30 PM] Jamie: Do you want to go out somewhere or my place or what?
[2017-04-24, 8:01:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd rather go somewhere
[2017-04-24, 8:02:14 PM] Jamie: OK name the place and I'm on my way
[2017-04-24, 8:03:04 PM] Rob Feeny: There aren't really any decent patios in Burnaby are there?
[2017-04-24, 8:03:32 PM] Jamie: Cactus club Café if it's open
[2017-04-24, 8:04:39 PM] Rob Feeny: That's by Brentwood right?
[2017-04-24, 8:05:03 PM] Jamie: Yes. Reps at Boston pizza
[2017-04-24, 8:05:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok let's give it a shot. Gimme 5 min to change then I'll leave
[2017-04-24, 8:08:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Was that intentional?
[2017-04-24, 8:09:03 PM] Jamie: Negative
[2017-04-24, 8:18:16 PM] Jamie: No patio. 25 minute wait for the lounge but there might be a seat at the bar
[2017-04-24, 8:19:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I'd be ok with the bar. Change of scenery
[2017-04-24, 8:19:22 PM] Rob Feeny: On the bike, leaving now. 10min
[2017-04-24, 10:16:12 PM] Rob Feeny: You can be a real dick, Jamie. I know you think you're helping by telling me what you think I need to hear, but you're callous and insensitive.
[2017-04-24, 10:23:42 PM] Jamie: I am sorry that I offended you. I realize I'm an easy target for your anger. Nobody has your back more than me Rob
[2017-04-24, 10:42:28 PM] Jamie: But I am sorry that instead of lifting your spirits, my intention, I sent you the other way.
[2017-04-24, 10:42:56 PM] Jamie: I do think that when you find your 'thing', you will be unstoppable.
[2017-04-26, 9:50:07 PM] Jamie: Still pissed at me?
‎[2017-09-18, 9:22:05 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2017-09-18, 9:22:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha wow..
[2017-09-18, 9:22:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Haven't seen that in a loooong time
[2017-09-18, 9:22:45 PM] Rob Feeny: In your CD player?
[2017-09-18, 9:22:46 PM] Jamie: I found the CD case with a bunch of your music in it

[2017-09-18, 9:23:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow. So retro. I want that case!
[2017-09-18, 9:24:19 PM] Jamie: I will throw it with the table
[2017-09-18, 9:30:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome. I have no tunes besides the radio in my car
[2017-09-18, 9:31:57 PM] Jamie: I'm going to head to X site for dinner if you haven't eaten
[2017-09-18, 9:32:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm at McKesson with Morgan still. Last day of the job. Thanks tho
[2017-09-20, 7:13:05 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob. Can you help me with my out of country insurance? I haven't been able to get it worked out in almost a month
[2017-09-20, 7:13:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure I'm just with an event right now
[2017-09-20, 7:13:43 PM] Rob Feeny: I could probably help you tomorrow or Friday
[2017-09-20, 7:14:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Or just fired me an email and maybe I can get some time tonight
[2017-09-20, 7:15:09 PM] Jamie: Yeah in the next few days is fine. Just can't seem to get any answers and keep finding loopholes etc
[2017-09-20, 7:15:53 PM] Rob Feeny: I know there's a limited time on the policy so what will probably happen is that when you're down there you will have to find a local policy
[2017-09-20, 7:16:13 PM] Jamie: What did you do?
[2017-09-20, 7:16:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Because all the policies basically assumed that they can send you back to Canada for free healthcare
[2017-09-20, 7:16:27 PM] Jamie: Yes
[2017-09-20, 7:17:03 PM] Jamie: But $900 for msp and then $1200 for additional insurance seems steep
[2017-09-20, 7:17:09 PM] Jamie: Ok will talk tomorrow
[2017-09-20, 7:19:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I know the NDP is about to cut the cost of Healthcare in half
[2017-09-20, 7:19:42 PM] Rob Feeny: How long were you looking to get a policy for that was 1200? A full year?
[2017-09-20, 7:19:57 PM] Jamie: Yes
[2017-09-20, 7:20:20 PM] Rob Feeny: I think I did six months and then when I was there found a local policy that was $600 for the whole year
[2017-09-20, 7:20:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Because after a certain amount of time out of Canada you can't be on MSP anymore
[2017-09-20, 7:20:47 PM] Rob Feeny: And the policy was really awesome from a huge global company
[2017-09-20, 7:21:48 PM] Jamie: Yeah it seems like I should do 3 months of travel with MSP, then put MSP on hold and get local insurance.
[2017-09-20, 7:39:10 PM] Jamie: OK can we make an appointment tomorrow evening to bring that furniture over to your place?
[2017-09-20, 7:39:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure, I'm free until 3pm. Noon?
[2017-09-20, 7:40:45 PM] Jamie: I have a webinar until noon. Maybe meet at my house at one?
[2017-09-20, 7:52:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok that works
[2017-09-21, 2:36:34 PM] Jamie: Heading back to the house in about 15 min. Think it will fit in your back seat?
[2017-09-21, 2:42:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm doubtful
[2017-09-21, 2:42:22 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll be there in 15
[2017-09-21, 3:01:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Your doorbell still goes to your old number
[2017-09-21, 3:01:32 PM] Jamie: Yes
[2017-09-21, 3:01:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to come let me in?
[2017-09-21, 3:01:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Or chuck me some keys
[2017-09-21, 3:01:58 PM] Jamie: 2 min, just getting there
[2017-09-21, 3:02:18 PM] Rob Feeny: K
[2017-09-21, 3:03:46 PM] Jamie: They really should post signs if they are gonna shut down the road again
[2017-09-22, 11:08:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha I'm sitting in my driveway with the music cranked
[2017-09-22, 11:08:38 AM] Jamie: That's awesome. Music has that ability
[2017-09-22, 6:40:23 PM] Jamie: Is Dad and Kathy coming tonight? The calendar invite says tomorrow
[2017-09-22, 6:48:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes they'll be here around 7
[2017-09-22, 6:49:23 PM] Jamie: OK. I have dinner with somebody at 6:45 but I'll swing by after that
[2017-09-22, 6:50:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2017-09-23, 5:38:05 PM] Jamie: Do you need a vacuum? I have that dyson
[2017-09-23, 5:38:36 PM] Rob Feeny: I have one but that one is better. I could hang onto it until you're back
[2017-09-23, 5:41:16 PM] Jamie: Ok. The cord is a little damaged but fixable
[2017-09-23, 5:47:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok no worries
[2017-09-25, 10:43:17 AM] Rob Feeny: The lawyer sent me the document to sign, just got to use Dan's printer later because mine's being a pain
[2017-09-25, 10:43:52 AM] Jamie: Ok great. Do they want the original?
[2017-09-25, 10:46:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope they said I could scan and email it back
[2017-09-25, 10:46:59 AM] Jamie: Sounds good
[2017-09-26, 6:50:27 PM] Jamie: Hey did you want the helmet and 2 motorcycle chain / locks?
[2017-09-29, 2:23:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Some days I feel like I'm going to lose my mind sitting in a coffee shop trying to focus
[2017-09-29, 2:29:06 PM] Jamie: Funny, it's the silence that makes me lose my mind. There is a comfort is the bustle. But some days...
[2017-09-29, 2:29:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Plus not having anything really to focus on. Supervans is getting me down, neither Morgan nor Andrew see benefit in any sort of planning.
[2017-09-29, 2:30:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Hence why we tend to go into business for ourselves
[2017-09-29, 2:30:07 PM] Jamie: Is that what you are there for?
[2017-09-29, 2:30:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Well it's either that or go install equipment at Morgan's
[2017-09-29, 2:30:41 PM] Jamie: Morgan is pretty frustrating to work for, I agree.
[2017-09-29, 2:30:55 PM] Rob Feeny: There's loads to do for Supervans but loads of it relies on those two
[2017-09-29, 2:31:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I think I'm going to look for a job
[2017-09-29, 2:31:30 PM] Jamie: Nothing from the tiny house place in Maple Ridge?
[2017-09-29, 2:31:34 PM] Rob Feeny: At the rate they are moving it should begin operation in 2019
[2017-09-29, 2:31:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope, Ben's done for the season
[2017-09-29, 2:31:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Heading to New Zealand
[2017-09-29, 2:31:53 PM] Jamie: Ahhhh.
[2017-09-29, 7:21:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you know if Morgan is pissed off at me for some reason, or just extra ornery lately?
[2017-09-29, 7:25:39 PM] Jamie: Don't think he's pissed.  He spends very little time thinking about other people tbh. Why?
[2017-09-29, 7:26:17 PM] Rob Feeny: I just asked him for some advice on a projector and he was a dick about it
[2017-09-29, 7:26:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Basically "I don't feel obligated to help your friend"
[2017-09-29, 7:27:03 PM] Jamie: Yeah sometimes he does get ornery or just cutting. Very rare which makes it more abrupt
[2017-09-29, 7:27:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I was thrown. But I think he was irritated with me last time I saw him because I wanted to Supervans work not install his stereo
[2017-09-29, 7:30:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok anyhow I'll just chalk it up to a bad Friday for Morgan
[2017-09-29, 7:40:12 PM] Jamie: I think that is wise.
[2017-09-29, 7:44:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Well now I don't want to ask him, do you know of any options that basically Sonos at a lower price point? For a very simple theater in his garage
[2017-09-29, 8:42:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I just cleaned a bunch of dust out of my microphone hole. Maybe that was the problem
[2017-10-02, 6:01:41 PM] Jamie: What's the password?
[2017-10-02, 6:01:49 PM] Jamie: For email money transfer?
[2017-10-02, 6:03:01 PM] Rob Feeny: toyotatacoma
[2017-10-02, 6:08:34 PM] Jamie: Hmmm failed twice
[2017-10-02, 6:10:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll go check in the acct
[2017-10-02, 6:12:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow the Tangerine site is really effed up
[2017-10-02, 6:12:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe that's why I spent 38 minutes getting an operator to refund that expire etransfer a bit ago
[2017-10-02, 6:12:44 PM] Jamie: Haha ok I will hold off then
[2017-10-02, 6:13:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah maybe tomorrow
[2017-10-02, 6:29:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok so their website difficulties overwrote all my etransfer passwords with my login pin. Wtf
[2017-10-02, 6:29:51 PM] Rob Feeny: So try "979333"
[2017-10-02, 6:30:48 PM] Jamie: Wow. Ok will try when I get back to my computer. Thanks
‎[2017-10-03, 3:51:35 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-03, 3:54:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow
[2017-10-03, 3:54:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Life in a bag
[2017-10-03, 5:31:00 PM] Jamie: You coming by tonight?
[2017-10-03, 5:35:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, working in West Van until 6. I'm on my bike tho so I'll have to get home for the car
[2017-10-03, 5:36:03 PM] Jamie: No worries. I'm there all night
[2017-10-03, 8:01:27 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll probably be there about 7:15. Will you have eaten?
[2017-10-03, 8:01:54 PM] Jamie: Nope. Happy to head out to xsite if you're down
[2017-10-03, 8:04:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Beauty. I'm starved. I'll. Update when I get home
[2017-10-03, 8:46:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ready to go
[2017-10-03, 8:46:27 PM] Jamie: Ok you heading here?
[2017-10-03, 8:47:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to just meet at X-site?
[2017-10-03, 8:48:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Or if your truck is all loaded up I can grab you
[2017-10-03, 8:56:44 PM] Jamie: Sorry was talking with a guy who came to buy some stuff
[2017-10-03, 8:57:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Np
[2017-10-03, 9:00:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Downstairs now
[2017-10-03, 9:00:42 PM] Jamie: K
[2017-10-03, 10:53:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha wasn't thinking and now I feel guilty for not buying your dinner after you gave me all that stuff!
[2017-10-03, 10:54:31 PM] Jamie: All good man. Not too concerned
[2017-10-04, 1:41:21 PM] Jamie: You wanted the scale right?
[2017-10-04, 1:54:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yah crap
[2017-10-04, 1:54:46 PM] Jamie: I can drop it when I bring my files
[2017-10-04, 2:01:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok thx
[2017-10-06, 2:32:18 PM] Jamie: Any chance I could drop my files there this afternoon or evening?
[2017-10-06, 2:34:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2017-10-06, 2:35:03 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm gone at 4:30ish
[2017-10-06, 2:35:06 PM] Rob Feeny: For the weekend
[2017-10-06, 2:35:48 PM] Jamie: OK I should be before that but if not I know where the key is. By the way the dollar store glue work perfect
[2017-10-06, 2:36:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Beauty
[2017-10-06, 2:57:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok spot cleared in my cold storage, off to the left
[2017-10-06, 3:07:34 PM] Jamie: Appreciate that
[2017-10-06, 3:08:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey did someone grab your spices? I forgot
[2017-10-06, 3:09:07 PM] Jamie: No. That whole cupboard is still full, ha ha. I forgot about it to
[2017-10-06, 3:10:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Whoops. Got a box? I could just take it all and dispose of whatever I don't need
[2017-10-06, 3:11:53 PM] Jamie: Sure that sounds good. I think it's all my best cooking ingredients so you probably want it all. I'll throw it in some of the gray bins that you can give to Morgan after you empty it
[2017-10-06, 3:13:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Beauty
[2017-10-06, 9:05:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Test
[2017-10-06, 9:05:44 PM] Jamie: Works
[2017-10-06, 9:05:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok beauty. Got data in the US
[2017-10-10, 8:39:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey did you leave that Lutron stuff for me or for someone to pick up?
[2017-10-10, 9:12:57 AM] Jamie: Oh sorry I sent you an email too. It's for Morgan
[2017-10-10, 9:13:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha you must have written that after I woke up and checked my email
[2017-10-10, 9:15:35 AM] Jamie: No worries. How was your trip?
[2017-10-10, 9:15:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Damn amazing. Beautiful place.
[2017-10-10, 9:15:58 AM] Rob Feeny: You on your way to Kelowna?
[2017-10-10, 9:16:01 AM] Jamie: What I can tell the pictures the weather cooperated
[2017-10-10, 9:16:06 AM] Jamie: Yes ma'am
[2017-10-10, 9:16:13 AM] Jamie: I am*
[2017-10-10, 9:16:35 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah we got soaked a few times and the nights were freezing but it was amazing. Good to see old friends
[2017-10-10, 9:16:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Yikes. Get a ride back sorted out?
[2017-10-10, 9:17:01 AM] Jamie: Yes I'm catching a ride with Tana and Geoff
[2017-10-10, 9:17:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh yes. Perfect
[2017-10-12, 6:30:21 PM] Jamie: Hey man, any chance you can give me a ride to the airport? Morgan has been backpedalling a little, lol
[2017-10-12, 6:30:40 PM] Jamie: I have to be at the airport for 5am 😁
[2017-10-12, 6:39:47 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2017-10-12, 6:40:02 PM] Rob Feeny: But you're buying me breakfast at the airport
[2017-10-12, 6:40:19 PM] Jamie: Oh heck ya. Thanks dude
[2017-10-12, 6:45:05 PM] Jamie: Probably is easiest if I crash on your couch on Sunday night?
[2017-10-12, 6:46:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup that works. Tana and Jeff will have vacated
[2017-10-12, 9:18:52 PM] Rob Feeny: I just looked into
Cotto as I went by and there was not a single person in there
[2017-10-12, 9:19:24 PM] Rob Feeny: at 7 p.m. on a Thursday night
[2017-10-12, 9:20:37 PM] Jamie: Wow. Game over I think
[2017-10-14, 12:51:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Anything I can bring for the party tonight?
[2017-10-14, 12:52:52 PM] Jamie: Not really, nothing I can think of good for yourself
[2017-10-14, 12:56:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool boss. See you tonight.
[2017-10-14, 1:26:52 PM] Jamie: Coolio
[2017-10-14, 1:42:33 PM] Jamie: Hey we are trying to fill the limo and could get it to stop and pick you guys up from dans. You interested?
[2017-10-14, 1:44:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man. I was just going to ride with Tana
[2017-10-14, 1:44:46 PM] Jamie: Ok no worries
[2017-10-15, 4:19:49 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm crashing for a bit but if you want to put your stuff over here, the door is open and there's a key under the recycling bin
[2017-10-15, 4:20:13 PM] Jamie: Cool. Just at Dans for a bit.  How are the bruises?
[2017-10-15, 4:20:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Not too bad actually. Don't feel much
[2017-10-15, 4:20:37 PM] Rob Feeny: We'll see how I am tomorrow
[2017-10-15, 9:27:48 PM] Jamie: Just over at Dans eating and doing laundry. Let me know when you are back
[2017-10-15, 9:30:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay I just dropped my friend off downtown and I'm headed home
[2017-10-15, 9:32:00 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2017-10-16, 8:03:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Damnit, stayed 1hr and 1 minute in parking
[2017-10-16, 8:04:13 AM] Jamie: Ruthless parking!
[2017-10-16, 7:47:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Where are you now?
[2017-10-16, 10:17:08 PM] Jamie: Just got to New York! Huge delays. May or may not make my next flight. Oh well, lol
[2017-10-16, 10:20:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Crap. Oh well, it's an adventure
[2017-10-16, 10:34:19 PM] Jamie: Ha ha they flew me into LaGuardia airport and then my connecting flight is at JFK. It’s a 25 minute cab ride
[2017-10-16, 10:35:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh crap. Were you supposed to arrive at JFK?
[2017-10-16, 11:19:36 PM] Jamie: I guess I was supposed take a cab
[2017-10-16, 11:19:49 PM] Jamie: I couldn’t figure out why my schedule changed last week. That must’ve been the change
[2017-10-16, 11:20:09 PM] Jamie: Didn’t make the flight. And I don’t think there’s another one till tomorrow at midnight
[2017-10-16, 11:20:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow, and they didn't book it that way originally?
[2017-10-16, 11:20:19 PM] Jamie: Not sure. Just got Internet
[2017-10-16, 11:20:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh fuck
[2017-10-16, 11:20:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Good luck
[2017-10-16, 11:20:43 PM] Jamie: Ha ha.
[2017-10-16, 11:32:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Well if you need any help from here, let us know
[2017-10-16, 11:41:19 PM] Rob Feeny: And technically, if it was booked as one itinerary, start to finish, they would have to find you another flight
[2017-10-17, 10:57:37 PM] Rob Feeny: I uncle James
[2017-10-17, 10:57:51 PM] Jamie: Hello!
[2017-10-17, 10:58:04 PM] Jamie: Made it to Montañita
[2017-10-17, 11:04:26 PM] Rob Feeny: It is Elex again that's great 🏙️
[2017-10-17, 11:05:30 PM] Jamie: Hi Elexandria, I thought it might be you
[2017-10-17, 11:05:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha she got distracted
‎[2017-10-17, 11:05:57 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-17, 11:06:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Glad to hear you're safe and sound
[2017-10-17, 11:06:14 PM] Jamie: Tell her that her banana toy made it too, lol
[2017-10-17, 11:06:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow a whole suite
[2017-10-17, 11:07:06 PM] Jamie: Yeah with a spare bed just in case I have guests lol
[2017-10-17, 11:07:16 PM] Jamie: And I have good Wi-Fi in my room
[2017-10-17, 11:07:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha sweet!
[2017-10-17, 11:07:33 PM] Rob Feeny: How long is that room yours?
[2017-10-17, 11:07:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Going to find an apartment quick?
[2017-10-17, 11:10:31 PM] Jamie: 1 month
[2017-10-17, 11:10:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yes the language school
[2017-10-17, 11:10:51 PM] Jamie: Rather 3 weeks and 3 days but whose counting, lol
[2017-10-17, 11:10:54 PM] Jamie: Yup yup
[2017-10-17, 11:15:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Get some sleep man. Glad you made it safe.
[2017-10-18, 3:12:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn this vacuum has a lot of attachments!
[2017-10-18, 3:13:02 PM] Jamie: Haha yes, yes it does. I don’t think I used any of them
[2017-10-18, 3:13:32 PM] Rob Feeny: The mounting plate holds two of them but not the other 5
[2017-10-18, 3:13:49 PM] Jamie: Weird

[2017-10-18, 3:18:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck you!
[2017-10-18, 3:20:10 PM] Jamie: Haha pretty wrecked today from all the travelling though. Slamming vitamin c and Tylenol and just laying low. Very much a party town, there has been techno music playing since I got here at 11pm. Glad I brought earplugs
[2017-10-18, 3:20:39 PM] Jamie: Gonna venture out for coffee and I will loss my wifi. Later!
[2017-10-18, 3:27:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Have fun man

[2017-10-19, 4:33:35 PM] Jamie: Very nice. I never got around to hang that thing
[2017-10-19, 4:38:20 PM] Rob Feeny: The only design flaw is that you're only supposed to charge it for 3.5hrs.. You have either unplug it or take it out of the holder?!
[2017-10-19, 4:39:00 PM] Jamie: Weird. Put a timer in line of the plug?
[2017-10-19, 4:42:05 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm going to research it more. It's only a diagram, no text so it might be saying you need to wait 3.5
‎[2017-10-19, 4:42:17 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-19, 4:42:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Got light now too
[2017-10-19, 4:44:48 PM] Jamie: Perfect sized light on the right. Man it looks awesome!
[2017-10-19, 4:44:53 PM] Jamie: Tv working?
‎[2017-10-19, 4:47:13 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-19, 4:48:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Threw a chromecast on the back, running off the service USB port. Other HDMI port has a long cable router through the wall for a laptop
‎[2017-10-19, 4:48:32 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-19, 4:48:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Reaches the couch
[2017-10-19, 4:48:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Your surfing pic looks great in the window. Who is that with you in it?
‎[2017-10-19, 4:49:18 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-19, 4:49:31 PM] Jamie: That’s not me. Cassidy’s mom took it in Tofino
[2017-10-19, 4:49:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Next step is an led strip on a timer in the top of the window to fake natural light and help the plants
[2017-10-19, 4:49:53 PM] Jamie: Yep that’ll be perfect
[2017-10-19, 4:50:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahh ok, Tana thought it was you and I
[2017-10-19, 5:05:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok FYI it's fine to leave it on the charger.
[2017-10-19, 5:13:17 PM] Jamie: Ah good to know. You really should come to this place you would love it. First day I was here and ended up at a beach bonfire with 10 people in the school.
‎[2017-10-19, 5:13:28 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-19, 5:18:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow man
[2017-10-19, 5:18:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks awesome
[2017-10-19, 5:18:20 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm hoping to come in Jan / Feb
[2017-10-19, 5:18:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Starting in Colombia ending in Ecuador
[2017-10-19, 5:51:57 PM] Jamie: Sweet
[2017-10-21, 11:19:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Cómo estás?
[2017-10-21, 5:32:49 PM] Jamie: Estoy bien. Spanish lessons start on Monday. I can understand a lot after only 3 days.
[2017-10-21, 5:33:05 PM] Jamie: This place has a great vibe to it
[2017-10-21, 5:33:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Killer!
[2017-10-21, 5:33:15 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm stoked for you
[2017-10-21, 5:33:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe I'll bring you El Principito when I come
[2017-10-21, 5:35:16 PM] Jamie: Sweet. I might actually be able to read it. Got a line on a sweet top floor room at a hostel right next to the school for 15 bucks a night in three weeks
[2017-10-21, 5:38:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome, you can become a fixture in the hostel
[2017-10-21, 5:38:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Like a mascot
[2017-10-21, 5:39:24 PM] Jamie: Haha for the ages of the girls here, a permanent daddy issue solution
[2017-10-21, 5:39:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Howso
[2017-10-21, 5:39:50 PM] Rob Feeny: all teenagers?
[2017-10-21, 5:39:54 PM] Jamie: There is probably 8 hot women here from 18-30.
[2017-10-21, 5:39:57 PM] Rob Feeny: hold on, be right there haha
[2017-10-21, 5:40:06 PM] Jamie: Average age is 22
[2017-10-21, 5:40:41 PM] Jamie: Chatted with an Australia doctor, 30, for about 4 hrs the other night
[2017-10-21, 5:40:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn man that's awesome
[2017-10-21, 5:41:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Any of them living there or just travellers?
[2017-10-21, 5:41:07 PM] Rob Feeny: It helps the spirits eh?
[2017-10-21, 5:43:01 PM] Jamie: Totally. All super friendly. The cabanas that house most of the student is a very welcoming place. English is the common language so that helps. Swiss, German, Dutch, Israeli, American, French
[2017-10-21, 5:43:09 PM] Jamie: Haha no Chinese at all
[2017-10-21, 5:43:28 PM] Jamie: If somebody new walks in within five minutes almost everybody has taken it upon themselves to introduce
[2017-10-21, 5:43:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha interesting, they've moved into Ecuador in a big way but I think more in the business side, no tourism
[2017-10-21, 5:43:45 PM] Jamie: We have an armband from the school that identifies as we get deals in town
[2017-10-21, 5:43:53 PM] Jamie: So you always know another Spanish school person
[2017-10-21, 5:45:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome. It's like a cult
[2017-10-21, 5:45:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Doing any surfing>
[2017-10-21, 5:45:40 PM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2017-10-21, 5:46:10 PM] Jamie: I have lesson starting Monday but I tried today. They were pretty ugly waves and I expended all my energy trying to get out and find a good one
[2017-10-21, 5:46:20 PM] Jamie: The last few days have really all been about recovering from the last three months of activity
[2017-10-21, 5:46:27 PM] Rob Feeny: You'll get back in shape old man
[2017-10-21, 5:46:33 PM] Rob Feeny: I've lost 13 lbs!?!
[2017-10-21, 5:46:41 PM] Rob Feeny: In maybe 6 weeks of crazy activity
[2017-10-21, 5:46:53 PM] Jamie: Nice! That feels good I bet
[2017-10-21, 6:21:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Totally. Now I just need to make more money haha
[2017-10-21, 6:22:06 PM] Rob Feeny: But by the end of the weekend my place will be where I want it to be for the next 6 months
‎[2017-10-21, 10:28:42 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-21, 10:28:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Does this make your inner lighting designer cringe?
[2017-10-21, 10:29:36 PM] Jamie: Haha the bear?
[2017-10-21, 10:30:05 PM] Rob Feeny: No the LED lights in the window
[2017-10-21, 10:31:00 PM] Jamie: No it looks totally fine. How was it switched?
[2017-10-21, 10:31:41 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a plug in setup, I hacked some wires together to make it run cleanely
‎[2017-10-21, 10:31:50 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-21, 10:31:57 PM] Rob Feeny: It runs under the couch to a timer
[2017-10-21, 10:33:06 PM] Rob Feeny: But there are switches on the lights too
[2017-10-21, 10:49:31 PM] Jamie: Nice !
[2017-10-24, 10:54:50 AM] Rob Feeny: The folks at Starbucks are asking about you. Wayne says you need to update FB
[2017-10-24, 10:58:50 AM] Jamie: Haha I will get right on it
[2017-10-24, 11:00:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Wayne says "yah, right"
[2017-10-26, 1:30:54 PM] Jamie: Hey man, D (Irish from Vanrun) is getting married in Ireland next Sept and I am planning on going. What’s the best site to figure out the cheapest way? So far about $1600 USD!!
[2017-10-26, 2:18:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Really it would be Google flight search. Search some options then set alerts for when it goes up or down
[2017-10-26, 2:26:18 PM] Jamie: No google flights in Ecuador 🙁
[2017-10-26, 2:54:51 PM] Rob Feeny: What do you mean? It doesn't work?
[2017-10-26, 2:55:07 PM] Rob Feeny: You can just go to Google.ca/flights
[2017-10-26, 2:55:26 PM] Rob Feeny: If you're paying with a Canadian card you should be able to book no problem
[2017-10-26, 2:55:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you get my email about depositing a cheque for you?
[2017-10-26, 2:58:53 PM] Jamie: It checks my browser and says it is not supported and offers me a list of other countries.
[2017-10-26, 3:01:01 PM] Jamie: Yup got it. Sent you a void cheque print. Thanks man!
[2017-10-26, 3:03:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Interesting. You could use a proxy service
[2017-10-26, 3:04:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Or I bet there's a way to use Dan's VPN to tunnel out to Canada
[2017-10-26, 3:04:26 PM] Jamie: Yeah I might. So far that’s the only thing. The crypto currency stuff didn’t restrict me and I haven’t used Netflix yet
[2017-10-26, 3:04:54 PM] Jamie: That’s true or I could put a router in Morgan’s place. We tried to set something up but found out at the last minute that the router we had wouldn’t do it
[2017-10-26, 3:05:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Going to put my phone away and hit the gym. Ttyl. I'll try the cheque after lunch
[2017-10-26, 3:05:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah might be helpful for a lot of things
[2017-10-26, 3:05:18 PM] Jamie: Cool man
‎[2017-10-26, 5:15:19 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-26, 6:56:09 PM] Jamie: Appreciate that
[2017-10-26, 7:46:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Any need for me to keep the slip?
[2017-10-26, 8:59:05 PM] Jamie: Nope
[2017-10-28, 1:31:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Random question... Morgan bought a bunch of 16/2 unshielded wire off you. Is it suitable / acceptable for running low voltage lights? I got a whole bunch of 30+ ft scraps from a job and will save it if so, for my tiny. It's stranded not solid so I wasn't sure if that would make a difference.
[2017-10-28, 1:33:41 PM] Jamie: Yup. We used it for all of our under counter and LED.
[2017-10-28, 1:34:41 PM] Jamie: I honestly don’t realize any difference between stranded and solid at medium wire sizes.
[2017-10-28, 1:38:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok beauty. I'm not a fan of the 18/2 LVT Westcoast uses for LV lighting so that stuff will work perfectly for me. Thanks
[2017-10-28, 5:39:26 PM] Jamie: Yeah the wire has to be rated as high a voltage as any other wire in a JB. So in a 120 V junction box, the low-voltage wire has to be rated for at least 120 V. The stuff that Rob uses is only good for 30 V
[2017-10-28, 5:39:47 PM] Jamie: Inspectors love to catch people on that
[2017-10-28, 6:50:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok but that Belden stuff is?
[2017-10-28, 8:46:51 PM] Jamie: 300v or 600v, can’t remember
[2017-10-28, 8:49:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome
[2017-10-30, 5:45:54 PM] Jamie: Ever had your MacBook track pad stop working?
[2017-10-30, 5:48:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. From a swelling batter
[2017-10-30, 5:48:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Battery
[2017-10-30, 5:49:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Couldn't click
[2017-10-30, 5:49:07 PM] Rob Feeny: And only half of it worked
[2017-10-30, 5:49:15 PM] Jamie: Hmmm clicks fine, no response
[2017-10-30, 5:49:32 PM] Rob Feeny: As in it doesn't register the click or you can't move around?
[2017-10-30, 5:49:40 PM] Jamie: Both
[2017-10-30, 5:53:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn not cool. That's a major hiccup
[2017-10-30, 5:53:40 PM] Jamie: It sure makes it difficult, lol
[2017-10-30, 5:54:00 PM] Jamie: At least buying a mouse may work
[2017-10-30, 5:55:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Does your laptop even have a USB port for the dongle or do you need a $35 adapter :O
[2017-10-30, 5:55:42 PM] Jamie: I have USB
[2017-10-30, 5:56:30 PM] Rob Feeny: I bought a Bluetooth mouse so it wouldn't occupy one of my USB ports but that might be harder to find there
[2017-10-30, 6:00:07 PM] Jamie: True. I will see if I can round up a USB mouse to at least do troubleshooting. Tomorrow. Gonna let the battery die completely just on the off chance it needs to cool
[2017-10-30, 6:01:48 PM] Jamie: How’s van?
‎[2017-10-30, 6:07:11 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-30, 6:07:17 PM] Rob Feeny: It's alright. Nothing special
[2017-10-30, 6:13:51 PM] Jamie: Hahah that’s awesome
[2017-10-30, 6:14:15 PM] Jamie: Did you dress up?
[2017-10-30, 6:14:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes as the monopoly guy
[2017-10-30, 6:15:16 PM] Jamie: Not the stuffed bear?
‎[2017-10-30, 6:15:24 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2017-10-30, 6:15:38 PM] Rob Feeny: No, decided to keep the moose. I'm using my old bear costume tonight
[2017-10-30, 6:16:00 PM] Jamie: Nice. What’s tonight?
[2017-10-30, 6:16:24 PM] Rob Feeny: The InterNations Halloween party. It's a group of Expats I belong to here
[2017-10-30, 6:16:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Good chance to go practice Spanish and meet people
[2017-10-30, 6:31:06 PM] Jamie: Now
[2017-10-30, 6:31:10 PM] Jamie: Noce*
[2017-10-30, 6:31:13 PM] Jamie: Fuck. Lol
[2017-10-30, 6:34:27 PM] Rob Feeny: And how's the good life?
[2017-10-30, 6:35:27 PM] Jamie: I was so sick for 5 days. Fever, cold spells, diarrhea, nausea, headache.
[2017-10-30, 6:35:41 PM] Jamie: Didn’t go to school, didn’t surf
[2017-10-30, 6:35:59 PM] Jamie: So the last 2 days I have been better and now I am gaining strength. Very happy
[2017-10-30, 6:48:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow. Yah some sort of local bug. At least you should be safe from it now
[2017-10-30, 6:49:00 PM] Rob Feeny: And you got a free cleanse out of it!
[2017-10-30, 6:49:07 PM] Jamie: Yup. Past the tough part
[2017-10-30, 6:49:22 PM] Jamie: Haha and I lost all my remaining fat
[2017-10-30, 6:49:43 PM] Jamie: Now to build. Pull ups and slack line, surfing
[2017-10-30, 6:53:56 PM] Rob Feeny: What's the food situation like?
[2017-10-30, 6:54:23 PM] Jamie: Really good actually. All kinds of good food (and attempts at good food)
[2017-10-30, 6:55:01 PM] Jamie: But I found my staples. Cook breakfast here and then maybe coffee / smoothly for lunch and then wherever for dinner
[2017-10-30, 6:56:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice. What are prices like?
[2017-10-30, 7:04:55 PM] Jamie: Pretty cheap. Booze is cheap of course. Meals can be about $7-10 if you are careful.
[2017-10-30, 7:07:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok ok so overall a fun place?
[2017-10-30, 7:08:09 PM] Jamie: Totally. Haven’t really partied yet because I have been sick but a great feel, access to cool people and beaches, cheap
[2017-10-30, 7:13:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, looking forward to checking it out
[2017-11-06, 10:30:53 PM] Rob Feeny: So how do you want to connect? Skype? Google Hangout?
[2017-11-06, 10:31:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Whatsapp video chat?
[2017-11-06, 10:54:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn, we're thinking maybe the time change led to miscommunication? Daylight saving time happened last night
[2017-11-10, 6:50:06 PM] Jamie: Hey dude. Sorry about the missed call. Met a beautiful Swiss girl and lost a week, lol
‎[2017-11-10, 6:50:47 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2017-11-10, 6:51:53 PM] Jamie: Also when are you planning your trip? I’m thinking Columbia early or mid January but nothing solid yet
[2017-11-10, 6:53:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Don't feel guilty about that haha sounds pretty great to me
[2017-11-10, 6:53:58 PM] Rob Feeny: driving
[2017-11-10, 9:54:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Was looking at February but not sure if I'm making enough money :S
[2017-11-10, 9:55:05 PM] Jamie: Ok well keep me posted. I am probably going to head to Columbia mid jan to see the Swiss girl, wanted to make sure it doesn’t conflict.
[2017-11-10, 9:55:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok no worries I'll let you know how I do
[2017-11-11, 9:36:23 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm heading on a hike with Kat Brine and her friend. Kat's driving and it's terrifying
[2017-11-11, 9:36:55 AM] Jamie: Haha that’s hilarious!
[2017-11-11, 9:37:19 AM] Rob Feeny: She jerks left and right nonstop and camps in the left lane
[2017-11-11, 9:38:02 AM] Jamie: Oh boy. Hope it’s not a long drive
[2017-11-11, 9:44:23 AM] Rob Feeny: 2 hours each way :S
[2017-11-11, 9:45:03 AM] Jamie: Holy crap. You guys are ambitious. Up early
[2017-11-11, 9:45:08 AM] Jamie: Expecting snow?
[2017-11-11, 9:52:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep, probably snowshoeing but have microspikes as well
[2017-11-11, 9:52:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Driving down to Mount baker
[2017-11-11, 9:53:07 AM] Rob Feeny: And getting seasick from the side to side motion
[2017-11-11, 9:55:21 AM] Jamie: I can totally picture this scene, lol
[2017-11-11, 9:56:00 AM] Jamie: This Swiss girl has kinda gone weird
[2017-11-11, 9:57:53 AM] Rob Feeny: How so? Did she leave
[2017-11-11, 9:58:13 AM] Rob Feeny: I find sometimes traveling girls want "vacation-ships"
[2017-11-11, 9:58:26 AM] Rob Feeny: So once you're in different places they change
[2017-11-11, 9:59:07 AM] Jamie: Her name is Selina. She left yesterday. Spent a great week with her but 2 hrs after she left she sent me a text ‘I miss you’ Which I got when I had wifi a few hrs later. I didn’t respond directly but said something else. She wrote back ‘nice response.    ....     ‘
[2017-11-11, 9:59:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh man
[2017-11-11, 9:59:30 AM] Rob Feeny: So she's rather codependent?
[2017-11-11, 9:59:40 AM] Jamie: I wrote something about the fact that we were the gossip with in the school. Then she said another text saying tell them whatever you want, for me it wasn’t a secret.
[2017-11-11, 9:59:48 AM] Rob Feeny: How old?
[2017-11-11, 9:59:53 AM] Jamie: 25
[2017-11-11, 10:00:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok so she's feeling like it wasn't as big a deal to you as it was to her
[2017-11-11, 10:00:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Cognitive dissonance
[2017-11-11, 10:00:42 AM] Rob Feeny: She's probably thinking "did he really like me or was I just a fun time?"
[2017-11-11, 10:00:56 AM] Jamie: Totally. And she wasn’t super stoked to leave so was probably grumpy
[2017-11-11, 10:01:38 AM] Rob Feeny: And in relation to most societies and people, I find people in our family to be very subtle about affection etc
[2017-11-11, 10:01:55 AM] Rob Feeny: So she might be wanting more feedback from you about you liking her etc
[2017-11-11, 10:01:58 AM] Jamie: But Seeing as I’ve only known her for about a week and a half, I don’t really owe her anything. If she’s going to be bitchy, I’m just going to ignore her texts. So it’s a lose lose situation for her
[2017-11-11, 10:02:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Awwww she's probably just insecure and it's coming out as bitchy
[2017-11-11, 10:03:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Especially since you're a lot older. She might be worrying you were using her or that it was crazy to get involved with a guy older than her
[2017-11-11, 10:03:09 AM] Jamie: You are probably right. She did something similar after about four days and I just ignored it and she got over it so that’s my plan
[2017-11-11, 10:03:28 AM] Rob Feeny: Or just give her a bit more attention if that's what she's seeking
[2017-11-11, 10:03:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Of course this is advice coming from a single guy haha
[2017-11-11, 10:03:50 AM] Rob Feeny: So it's worth what you pay for it ;)
[2017-11-11, 10:04:18 AM] Jamie: Haha I think giving a girl like that tons of attention is a trap
[2017-11-11, 10:04:58 AM] Jamie: But what a rocking body she has. Not super skinny and athletic but unbelievable curves.
[2017-11-11, 10:05:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Not tons, just enough haha make her earn it!
[2017-11-11, 10:05:34 AM] Jamie: Yes. No reward for bitchy behaviour but once she is nice again, heap it on
[2017-11-11, 10:07:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Glad you're enjoying it down there man
[2017-11-11, 10:07:34 AM] Rob Feeny: It's good for your soul to learn that outside of Vancouver it's easier haha
[2017-11-11, 10:08:03 AM] Jamie: Totally. It was very cute how it worked out actually. Props to her.
[2017-11-11, 10:09:18 AM] Rob Feeny: She chased you?
[2017-11-11, 10:09:25 AM] Jamie: Her lymph nodes were swollen the night before and she had worried a little bit about not being able to breathe. I told her I was number eight if she woke up in a panic. Wink wink.
[2017-11-11, 10:09:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Border crossing, it'll take a minute to swap cards
[2017-11-11, 10:10:12 AM] Jamie: So the next day we hung out and went out for dinner and then I dropped her off at her cabana. Three minutes later she knocked on my door and said I know this may be cheesy but I could die so I think I better sleep here tonight
[2017-11-11, 9:06:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok sounds like she's into you in a big way
[2017-11-11, 9:07:18 PM] Jamie: Actually she is losing it on Facebook right now.
[2017-11-11, 9:07:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh god. So she's a nutter?
[2017-11-11, 9:15:52 PM] Jamie: Yes. She sent a pic with a heart three hours ago and then when I didn’t respond she got pissed. I got the pissed message before the photo came, lol. After I came back to wifi. I sent her a screen shot and she still was pissed. Whatever
[2017-11-11, 9:17:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Yikes
[2017-11-13, 7:33:50 PM] Jamie: Well my computer trackpad and keyboard have died. 🙁
[2017-11-13, 7:35:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Well that's certainly a setback
[2017-11-13, 7:51:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Any options for repair?
[2017-11-13, 7:52:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Need me to mail you something?
[2017-11-13, 10:38:56 PM] Jamie: Nah I’m gonna search out the tools to open it up but I may have to go to the capital city Quito and just buy new computer. Fix this one when I get back. Or I may be able to drop the computer there and then come back in a couple weeks. Not too stressed about it right now.
[2017-11-13, 10:39:15 PM] Jamie: I take it you survived hiking with Kat?
[2017-11-13, 10:39:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow you couldn't do it in Guayaquil?
[2017-11-13, 10:39:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yes. And met a cute friend of hers
[2017-11-13, 10:39:47 PM] Rob Feeny: She's intense
[2017-11-13, 10:39:53 PM] Rob Feeny: And the worst driver ever
[2017-11-13, 10:40:19 PM] Jamie: Haha yeah she is. Might be able to do it in Guayaquil but I met another girl that is going to be in Quito so I might visit her
[2017-11-13, 10:40:28 PM] Jamie: This place is so chock-full of 25-year-old beautiful women it’s insane
[2017-11-13, 10:40:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha
[2017-11-13, 10:40:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Sounds like heaven
[2017-11-13, 10:43:35 PM] Jamie: I love it. But the sun hasn’t been out for more than about 30 minutes for the last 3 weeks.
[2017-11-13, 10:44:16 PM] Jamie: Which sucks but still a great time.
[2017-11-13, 10:44:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh wow. Winter at its worst
[2017-11-13, 10:44:44 PM] Rob Feeny: How's the surfing?
[2017-11-13, 10:45:37 PM] Jamie: Surfing is great actually. Big ass waves that destroy me. But very accessible and I am getting into a ritual of surfing each day now so I am getting better. Still feel out of shape
[2017-11-13, 10:46:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Beauty.
[2017-11-13, 10:46:14 PM] Rob Feeny: And you are out of shape, fatty
[2017-11-13, 10:46:59 PM] Jamie: Actually the week long diarrhea fixed that haha. Skinny as hell
[2017-11-13, 10:48:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Yikes, isn't that usually just dehydration? Drink some beers!
[2017-11-13, 10:49:06 PM] Jamie: Actually barely drinking or smoking pot. Had 2 beers tonight but it’s rare and it’s because I went out to the welcome dinner for the new students.
[2017-11-13, 10:49:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Just surfing and studying and working on cute 25yr olds?
[2017-11-13, 10:49:51 PM] Jamie: Met an Aussie girl named Steph that I have been swimming and eating with most days and she was there
[2017-11-13, 10:50:00 PM] Jamie: Yes. Excactly.
[2017-11-13, 10:50:15 PM] Rob Feeny: I hate you
[2017-11-13, 10:50:43 PM] Jamie: Haha sorry man. Guess you gotta come here
[2017-11-13, 10:50:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha i need income first
[2017-11-13, 10:51:30 PM] Jamie: True story
[2017-11-13, 11:03:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey what do you know about using bitcoin/cryptocurrencies to transfer $$ to other countries? I want to send a bit of cash to a friend in Venezuela but I can't through a normal bank
[2017-11-14, 10:29:15 AM] Jamie: Still no easy way. Can they spend the money as bitcoin? It does it have to be converted back to dollars / local correct
[2017-11-14, 10:30:12 AM] Jamie: Check out something called shapeshift. Might be an app, might be a website.
[2017-11-14, 10:31:52 AM] Jamie: Never mind no fist
[2017-11-14, 10:31:55 AM] Jamie: Fiat*
[2017-11-14, 10:32:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Ya they need to convert it to Venezuelan bolívares
[2017-11-14, 10:33:35 AM] Jamie: Localbitcoins.com?
[2017-11-14, 10:33:34 AM] Rob Feeny: Didn't understand that, even with fiat
[2017-11-14, 10:34:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Saw it, haven't had a chance to explore it in depth yet
[2017-11-14, 10:34:38 AM] Rob Feeny: Just learned this am that they can do face to face transactions
[2017-11-14, 10:35:06 AM] Jamie: Shafeshift allows you to exhange crypto currencies between themselves. But you cannot convert bitcoin to bolívares and send to a bank account. Fiat = non crypto currencies
[2017-11-14, 10:35:14 AM] Rob Feeny: The problem is that if I send it via the banking system, they get the official exchange rate which is 1/10th the real one
[2017-11-14, 10:36:04 AM] Jamie: Yeah localbitcoins is pretty much a Grey/Black market at the mercy of random people
[2017-11-14, 10:36:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I might try to find someone on local bitcoin that is willing to hand over hard bolívares in person in exchange for bitcoin
[2017-11-14, 10:36:31 AM] Jamie: Best bet I think. Any other way will involve a bank account
[2017-11-14, 10:39:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok thanks. The only other option I'm looking at is sending the money via western union to Colombia as she's right on the border
[2017-11-17, 4:04:32 PM] Jamie: Hey man how’s things?
[2017-11-17, 4:05:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Quite good. Busy lately . You?
[2017-11-17, 4:06:15 PM] Jamie: Surfing everyday and Spanish 5 days a week. Taking next week off Spanish to study Verbs, adjectives and nouns, before I go to the next level.
[2017-11-17, 4:06:30 PM] Jamie: Making money?
[2017-11-17, 4:07:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice! Bit by bit
[2017-11-17, 4:07:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, never enough but I'm paying the bills
[2017-11-17, 4:07:44 PM] Rob Feeny: I spend it too fast
[2017-11-17, 4:08:01 PM] Rob Feeny: On to your next 25yr old yet?
[2017-11-17, 4:08:05 PM] Jamie: Well as long as you are getting to do some of the things you want.
[2017-11-17, 4:08:15 PM] Jamie: Oh god. She went nutso
‎[2017-11-17, 4:08:54 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2017-11-17, 4:10:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man
[2017-11-17, 4:10:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Dodged a bullet
[2017-11-17, 4:10:38 PM] Jamie: Yeah it’s too bad she is hurting but...
[2017-11-17, 4:10:51 PM] Jamie: Any girls on the go?
[2017-11-17, 4:13:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Not really. Julia went a bit squirrely and I was hanging out with an Australian girl but she works too much and really only likes to interact in person so it's going nowhere
[2017-11-17, 4:15:43 PM] Jamie: Lame. Haha there is another 24 year old from Australia but I need to pick my girls carefully to not get a bad rep, lol
[2017-11-17, 4:19:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep. Except eventually, everything will refresh!
[2017-11-17, 4:21:13 PM] Jamie: Actually it’s surprising how many people are here for 3,4,5 even 6 months. But yes. Most people are 3-4 weeks
[2017-11-17, 4:27:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh wow, nice. I'm jealous. Winter is already getting me down
[2017-11-17, 4:29:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Is your surfing improving?
[2017-11-17, 4:29:07 PM] Jamie: Has it been raining? Here we have not seen the sun in 3 weeks
[2017-11-17, 4:29:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah it's like 6 degrees and rainy every day
[2017-11-17, 4:29:39 PM] Jamie: Yup. Super stoked about my surfing. Late start with being sick and the girl but yesterday I felt super confidant.
[2017-11-17, 4:30:20 PM] Jamie: I am working on my paddle strength and duck diving through the breaks. Everything to get out to the lineup with more endurance and strength for when the waves come.
[2017-11-17, 4:30:33 PM] Jamie: Still suck at actually surfing the waves but soon...
[2017-11-17, 4:33:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha
[2017-11-17, 4:33:38 PM] Rob Feeny: One day you'll stand up
[2017-11-17, 4:34:47 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah. Soon. Too cold to surf today though. Just couldn’t do it
[2017-11-17, 4:40:27 PM] Rob Feeny: That sucks. So what do you do on days off?
[2017-11-17, 4:41:59 PM] Jamie: There hasn’t been many, lol. Surf trips on Saturdays to a beach about 1 hr away, the Amazon for one weekend, sick for one and Selina for another.
[2017-11-17, 4:42:40 PM] Jamie: But the days seem to get filled. Reading and drinking coffee when I can and of course eating!
[2017-11-17, 4:43:43 PM] Jamie: Surf trip tomorrow and Sunday we are going on a tour of the Isla de la plata which is a cheaper Galapagos I hear
[2017-11-17, 4:46:17 PM] Rob Feeny: The island if the silver. Sounds cool...
[2017-11-17, 4:46:32 PM] Rob Feeny: How is it money wise? Your funds going to last?
[2017-11-17, 4:47:27 PM] Jamie: Yeah still don’t have the budget nailed down. But it’s cheap to live, eat and surf.
[2017-11-17, 4:48:39 PM] Jamie: The Spanish school Cabañas I stay in are about $23 a night, so about $700 a month. I could move to a place for $10 down the road which would save me money but I love the place I’m at
[2017-11-17, 4:49:08 PM] Jamie: School is about $550 a month so between the 2 that is most of my outlay
[2017-11-17, 4:49:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah it's not a crazy amount of money tho for the experience
[2017-11-17, 4:50:13 PM] Jamie: About $16 a day for food but I am eating pretty cheap right now and barely drinking. One dinner at a nice place here can be $30- $40 with drinks easy
[2017-11-17, 4:50:39 PM] Jamie: And haven’t really travelled much which is expensive.
[2017-11-17, 4:51:00 PM] Jamie: But about 30% cheaper than expected.
[2017-11-17, 4:54:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow, that's pricey for food for me, but it is a tourist spot I guess. Are most of the people there foreigners?
[2017-11-17, 4:57:00 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah most expensive place in town.  There are 2 others around that price but the food is incredible for Ecuador standards. Losing wifi, later bro!
[2017-11-17, 7:55:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn, 940$ to fly to Bogotá Feb 1 and out of Guayaquil Mar 2
[2017-11-18, 12:11:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Did you just feel an earthquake?
[2017-11-18, 5:44:20 PM] Jamie: Nope slept through that one but felt the earlier one at school. Pretty small
[2017-11-18, 5:45:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I just was chatting with a friend down there when she felt it
[2017-11-18, 5:46:23 PM] Jamie: Cleared out the school pretty fast. A couple months ago, there was a bigger one much closer
[2017-11-18, 5:47:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah I wouldn't want to be in a cinder block or concrete building during one
[2017-11-18, 5:48:00 PM] Jamie: It’s concrete 🙁
[2017-11-18, 5:48:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Made by underpaid workers who didn't really know what they were doing...
[2017-11-18, 5:58:54 PM] Jamie: Haha totally.
[2017-11-19, 9:29:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey. It's your birthday. Holy crap yours old.
[2017-11-19, 9:29:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Hope it was fun last night and today is a book reading day.
[2017-11-19, 7:00:32 PM] Jamie: Last night was amazing actually
[2017-11-19, 7:16:01 PM] Jamie: And it was an Island tour today for my bday. So tired
[2017-11-27, 10:08:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Still trying to work out a time to visit, looks like my friend in Venezuela has vacation in March. It also looks like that's a good time of year to be visiting. Will you still be around?
[2017-11-27, 10:26:49 AM] Rob Feeny: I might have to reverse my trip, start in Ecuador and head to Colombia, because her vacation isn't until March 15th
[2017-11-27, 12:13:49 PM] Jamie: I think by March I might be in Panama or Costa Rica. My three month visa ends January 15 and it would cost me 500 bucks American to extend it. If I leave a week earlier that means I can come back to Ecuador and then just overstay my visa.
[2017-11-27, 12:13:56 PM] Jamie: I have to go surf now but do you want to chat later tonight maybe?
[2017-11-27, 12:15:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok interesting. I wasn't going to come until February anyway with my original plan
[2017-11-27, 12:15:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Let's chat tonight
[2017-12-05, 2:10:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha we forgot to chat.
[2017-12-05, 2:11:57 PM] Rob Feeny: You know it's going to be a good day when you try to sniff a squeeze bottle at the pizza place to confirm it's hot sauce and manage to squirt hot sauce up your nose.. And how's YOUR day going?
[2017-12-05, 3:06:20 PM] Jamie: Oh crap! That sounds painful, lol. Day is good so far, going surfing now.  What’s a good day to chat?
[2017-12-05, 3:06:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Hah this week? Sunday?
[2017-12-05, 3:07:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Doing Morgan stuff during the day for his new rental and AV at night
[2017-12-05, 3:07:51 PM] Jamie: Wow. Busy guy. Yeah Sunday works, all the days are the same here
[2017-12-05, 3:08:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Lucky bastard
[2017-12-10, 9:20:06 PM] Jamie: Chatting tonight?
[2017-12-10, 9:20:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I was just about to message you
[2017-12-10, 9:21:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Just need to eat then I'm free. How's your schedule?
[2017-12-10, 9:21:47 PM] Jamie: Good. Tired though. Surfing and swimming today
[2017-12-10, 9:22:06 PM] Rob Feeny: 30min?
[2017-12-10, 9:22:22 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2017-12-10, 9:51:36 PM] Rob Feeny: 5min, just finishing food
[2017-12-10, 9:54:51 PM] Rob Feeny: My yam fries are taking forever
[2017-12-10, 9:55:44 PM] Jamie: No worries just reading my book
[2017-12-10, 10:02:50 PM] Rob Feeny: What have you found works best? Skype? Google hangout?
[2017-12-10, 10:03:15 PM] Jamie: WhatsApp is good
[2017-12-23, 7:14:35 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob how’s it going there?
[2017-12-23, 7:15:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Good! Reading a book by the fire at Dean's
[2017-12-23, 7:15:29 PM] Rob Feeny: How's Montañita?
[2017-12-23, 7:15:35 PM] Jamie: Ahh very nice.
[2017-12-23, 7:16:35 PM] Jamie: Montañita is pretty sweet. I have served so much in the last two days, I can permanently the motion of the waves
[2017-12-23, 7:16:39 PM] Jamie: Surfed*
[2017-12-23, 7:17:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha sea legs
[2017-12-23, 7:19:36 PM] Jamie: Yup. Feeling like Christmas there?
[2017-12-23, 7:19:43 PM] Jamie: Tell everyone I say hi!

[2017-12-30, 2:49:33 PM] Rob Feeny: You just bought me a snow brush for Christmas. Thanks man!
[2017-12-30, 2:50:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Message
[2017-12-30, 2:51:06 PM] Rob Feeny: I just cashed all your Canadian Tire
[2017-12-30, 6:31:48 PM] Jamie: Nice!  Merry hoho
[2018-01-19, 3:22:48 PM] Jamie: Wanna buy part of an island with me? https://www.point2homes.com/CA/Vacant-Land-For-Sale/BC/Vancouver-Island/Alberni-Clayoquot/LT-9-KVARNO-ISLAND/43665184.html
[2018-01-19, 3:25:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn that looks amazing
[2018-01-19, 3:26:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd sign on for payments, just don't have capital
[2018-01-19, 3:26:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Bet you could get a sailboat in there
[2018-01-19, 3:29:31 PM] Jamie: Exactly what I thought. Well water, no septic. I would love to drop a tiny house on there, complete with solar and rain barrels. 5 acres!
[2018-01-19, 3:30:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup and protected from storms
[2018-01-19, 3:30:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Actually I could probably scrape together 10k
[2018-01-19, 3:31:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm surprised well water would be drinkable there, it's a small island
[2018-01-19, 3:31:17 PM] Jamie: Totally! I sent an email asking some specific questions, like is it leasehold/freehold,  any restrictions on building, can we build our own dock etc.
[2018-01-19, 3:31:46 PM] Jamie: Probably isn’t drinkable without being filtered. Not sure. Any questions you can think of that I should send her?
[2018-01-19, 3:32:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Just what you had asked.. Freehold vs stratified etc, who covers the maintenance on the dock and common pathways. What building code it falls under, and environmental concerns / protected areas or species
[2018-01-19, 3:33:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Selling prices on other lots on that island
[2018-01-19, 3:33:32 PM] Rob Feeny: It would even be worth calling some locals and asking about it
[2018-01-19, 3:33:33 PM] Jamie: Ok will send to her. It’s pretty close to Tofino. Perfect for me and I know you wanted a place to drop a tiny house. Probably plenty of room for two on that 5 acres
[2018-01-19, 3:34:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Post on FB asking if anyone has friends in Uclulet who you could talk to
[2018-01-19, 3:35:01 PM] Jamie: Good plan. Not in a hurry on this, several lots have been on the market for over a year
[2018-01-19, 3:35:17 PM] Jamie: Got to go surfing now, hope all is well
[2018-01-19, 3:35:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Have fun man
[2018-01-20, 11:51:42 AM] Rob Feeny: So Kvarno Island is outside of the Ucluelet municipal boundaries, so building codes should be less restrictive
[2018-01-20, 12:19:21 PM] Jamie: I will send you a link to the docs I have now and an email forward as well. There are 2 for sale, 12 and 9 I believe. Which one is better?
[2018-01-20, 12:20:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I'd say I'll take a look at the elevations but Kvarno Island disappears on Google maps when you switch to terrain
[2018-01-20, 12:21:11 PM] Jamie: Yeah weird right? Only on satellite
[2018-01-20, 12:21:23 PM] Jamie: Email sent, can you open Dropbox links?
[2018-01-20, 12:23:58 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll need my laptop, Dropbox insists on only opening pdfs in their app
[2018-01-20, 12:24:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Brb
[2018-01-20, 12:27:28 PM] Rob Feeny: What I'd be looking for is southern exposure for solar and light
[2018-01-20, 12:27:46 PM] Rob Feeny: For that, I'm looking for a topo map
[2018-01-20, 12:30:15 PM] Jamie: Ahhh nice. On google earth you can see a driveway that has been cleared and a building spot already prepped. For what that’s worth
[2018-01-20, 12:32:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah good call, just loading it
‎[2018-01-20, 12:35:19 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-01-20, 12:38:14 PM] Rob Feeny: just mucking around in google earth to see which lot has best facing
[2018-01-20, 12:39:58 PM] Jamie: Yeah the one with the inlet has the option for a private dock but the other one has to use the common dock
[2018-01-20, 12:40:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm damn because the one by the common dock ghas better sun
‎[2018-01-20, 12:40:54 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-01-20, 12:40:57 PM] Rob Feeny: The view facing north
[2018-01-20, 12:41:45 PM] Jamie: Because the trees would shade?
[2018-01-20, 12:42:49 PM] Rob Feeny: yah if you look at the layout of the one with the inlet, half your building spots would be on a northwest facing slope, the best ones would be tucked in the V
‎[2018-01-20, 12:46:56 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-01-20, 12:47:05 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd say tht's where you'd want to be building
[2018-01-20, 12:47:14 PM] Rob Feeny: The inlet is pretty damn cool though
‎[2018-01-20, 12:50:11 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-01-20, 12:53:23 PM] Jamie: Not sure. Pretty awesome piece of property though, hey?
[2018-01-20, 12:53:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2018-01-20, 12:53:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Just messaging a friend who works in GIS systems to see if she hs access to some better data
[2018-01-20, 12:56:28 PM] Rob Feeny: looks line 9,10 & 12 are for sale?
[2018-01-20, 12:57:18 PM] Jamie: I think so. I did manage to find the assessment on these properties and didn’t see any history of sales for any but didn’t check thoroughly.
[2018-01-20, 12:57:54 PM] Rob Feeny: shame someone got lot 11!
[2018-01-20, 12:59:15 PM] Jamie: I figure if I buy it, I would probably have to get a job for a while as an electrician to pay for the work needed, go there on weekends. Seems like my only chance to get oceanfront property near Tofino (even without utilities).
[2018-01-20, 1:00:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah but who needs utilities, you could throw solar on it
[2018-01-20, 1:00:11 PM] Rob Feeny: (yah I know, more cost)
[2018-01-20, 1:01:55 PM] Jamie: That’s fine. If I buy the one for $129,000 that leaves enough to get started on a tiny house build with solar. I could get running water to it and would have to deal with an outhouse until I could get a septic field figured out
[2018-01-20, 1:02:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, you could do a composting toilet as well, there are some good options that are not nearly as bad as an outhouse
[2018-01-20, 1:04:48 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm trying to find some pics that actually show the isl;and normally
[2018-01-20, 1:05:02 PM] Jamie: Yeah I didn’t have much luck.
[2018-01-20, 1:05:09 PM] Rob Feeny: https://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fexghuob2nIk%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dexghuob2nIk&docid=oxX2bMZ3rWA_bM&tbnid=NPIzZwlyADwP2M%3A&vet=10ahUKEwjgxJGSj-fYAhUqwVQKHffVCGcQMwg_KAAwAA..i&w=1920&h=1080&bih=676&biw=1271&q=kvarno%20island&ved=0ahUKEwjgxJGSj-fYAhUqwVQKHffVCGcQMwg_KAAwAA&iact=mrc&uact=8
[2018-01-20, 1:06:01 PM] Rob Feeny: https://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fexghuob2nIk%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dexghuob2nIk&docid=oxX2bMZ3rWA_bM&tbnid=NPIzZwlyADwP2M%3A&vet=10ahUKEwjgxJGSj-fYAhUqwVQKHffVCGcQMwg_KAAwAA..i&w=1920&h=1080&bih=676&biw=1271&q=kvarno%20island&ved=0ahUKEwjgxJGSj-fYAhUqwVQKHffVCGcQMwg_KAAwAA&iact=mrc&uact=8#h=1080&imgdii=nTj_vi9gjTjB3M:&vet=10ahUKEwjgxJGSj-fYAhUqwVQKHffVCGcQMwg_KAAwAA..i&w=1920
[2018-01-20, 1:07:01 PM] Jamie: Relocating to my coffee shop, back on wifi in about 10 min
[2018-01-20, 1:07:05 PM] Rob Feeny: was hoping to find a view into that inlet
‎[2018-01-20, 1:08:49 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-01-20, 1:14:17 PM] Jamie: Haha I wonder what type of other people would be on this island
[2018-01-20, 1:15:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah.. a mix of salty types and big city types?
[2018-01-20, 1:15:08 PM] Rob Feeny: shame you couldn't get a couple lots
[2018-01-20, 1:15:12 PM] Rob Feeny: populate it with friends
[2018-01-20, 1:16:09 PM] Jamie: Yeah I would have to liquidate almost everything or get a mortgage. And I don’t have a job, lol
[2018-01-20, 1:17:19 PM] Rob Feeny: That part's tough. Get Morgan to put you on the books of Effortless for a few months
[2018-01-20, 1:17:32 PM] Rob Feeny: He's down with bending the rules...
[2018-01-20, 1:21:18 PM] Rob Feeny: did you watch the youtube video?
[2018-01-20, 1:22:21 PM] Jamie: Yeah I did. Not a lot of different views. I want to hire a guy with a drone to fly over it and follow my instructions, lol
[2018-01-21, 2:19:18 PM] Jamie: How the hell would I get a tiny house placed on the building spot, lol? Drag it?
[2018-01-21, 2:39:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Two ways. If it's a THOW (Tiny House On Wheels) you would bring it and a truck over on a barge
[2018-01-21, 2:39:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Depends what those roads on the island are like
[2018-01-21, 2:40:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Or if it's just built on a sledge you could see if a crane barge could get close enough to drop it on place
[2018-01-21, 2:40:51 PM] Rob Feeny: You should ask if anyone has any vehicles on the island
[2018-01-21, 2:41:27 PM] Rob Feeny: They tend to have old trucks etc because you don't need insurance etc. Daniel has an old beater jeep on Gambier that is totally not street legal (no doors, lights etc
[2018-01-21, 5:40:26 PM] Jamie: Crane barge sounds expensive, any idea if the price?
[2018-01-21, 5:40:56 PM] Jamie: I have sent the poor lady quite a few emails, lol
[2018-01-21, 5:50:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Depends on what's in the area, being coastal is good but if there's nothing local, crazy expensive. If something local, maybe 5-8k?
[2018-01-21, 5:51:02 PM] Rob Feeny: I thought I saw one ad for a lot on there with an RV on it?
[2018-01-21, 5:52:23 PM] Rob Feeny: If they pulled a well-drilling rig onto the island, there has to be a barge with a drop down ramp in the area
[2018-01-21, 5:53:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Something that bridges the gap between the barge and high water mark. We used something similar on Saturna Island
[2018-01-21, 5:53:54 PM] Rob Feeny: So I'd be fairly sure you'd be able to haul a trailer mounted TH onto the island, you'd just have to make sure you extended the road on your lot to the location you want
[2018-01-21, 5:56:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I could see us chartering the barge, loading it with a TH, building supplies, crushed gravel, and 'Island vehicle' like an ATV and an excavator. The excavator could extend the road to the building site, spread the crushed gravel and then haul the TH into position
[2018-01-21, 5:57:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Then it could shift all the building materials you want for any outbuildings, deck, solar array, septic field etc onto your property before going back on the barge
[2018-01-21, 5:57:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I've got a few friends who have experience in this that could provide advice
[2018-01-21, 6:09:40 PM] Jamie: Cool. Makes more sense to use existing roads to move a a THOW to the building site that is there already. Could probably even just winch it bit by bit onto the beach after that, lol
[2018-01-21, 6:10:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yes but you won't want it right on the beach, due to king tides, waves, tsunami
[2018-01-21, 6:10:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Have it close but up higher, build stairs down to a deck near the shore...
[2018-01-21, 6:33:33 PM] Jamie: Love it!
[2018-01-21, 6:35:26 PM] Jamie: Probably just inside the tree line
[2018-01-21, 6:35:29 PM] Rob Feeny: There are probably setbacks you have to observe and if you can out in septic it will need to be a certain distance from the ocean and you won't want it to be uphill. I can picture it already tho
[2018-01-21, 6:36:03 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm sure waves crash into the treeline but you can clear a patch, tuck it in
[2018-01-21, 6:36:40 PM] Jamie: Awesome! Man this is really tempting.
[2018-01-21, 6:36:43 PM] Rob Feeny: It will help that its not a steep Rocky island
[2018-01-21, 6:37:22 PM] Rob Feeny: If full time living is your goal, I'd bet having a private dock would help a lot
[2018-01-21, 6:37:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Just hop in your boat and zip across to your truck
[2018-01-21, 6:37:39 PM] Jamie: I should just do it and deal with the details later
[2018-01-21, 6:37:57 PM] Jamie: Yeah I would have to have parking for my truck and boat on the Mainland
[2018-01-21, 6:38:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup but that's not a crazy hard thing. It's a small town
[2018-01-21, 6:38:48 PM] Rob Feeny: I emailed a local tiny house builder asking some questions, but I know he lives full time in a TH in Tofino and so does another person
[2018-01-21, 6:44:39 PM] Jamie: Very cool man. Please put me in touch. What should my budget be for a THOW?
[2018-01-21, 6:50:11 PM] Rob Feeny: That really depends on your standards and goals. A nice, fancy CSA approved unit, 26ft long like the one I'm designing would be 90k? A small simple one without the same level of luxury or certification could be 40?
[2018-01-21, 6:50:47 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm giving him a couple days to reply then I'll follow up with a call
[2018-01-21, 6:51:36 PM] Rob Feeny: There's also the option of buying an RV or travel van and living in it as you build something on site, but that's challenging due to getting materials and contractors to the site
[2018-01-21, 6:59:06 PM] Rob Feeny: But I have to say, once you buy the property, there's a hell of a lot of work and money to get it to a liveable place.
[2018-01-21, 7:00:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet you could burn 50k on boat, subcontractors, water and electrical equipment to get set up
[2018-01-21, 7:00:24 PM] Rob Feeny: And that's without a dock
[2018-01-22, 10:57:31 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey sorry for getting all pessimistic yesterday. I realized I was externalizing my anxiety.
[2018-01-22, 10:57:47 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm very willing to work with you to come up with realistic numbers
[2018-01-22, 10:58:17 AM] Rob Feeny: And there are many things we could do, like clearing trees with dad's chainsaw etc to minimize
[2018-01-22, 10:58:21 AM] Jamie: All good man. They are probably realistic numbers.
[2018-01-22, 10:59:01 AM] Jamie: Yeah I am very tempted to just do it and then sort the details later. I could even live in Nanaimo in work and just go there on the weekends during the build phase
[2018-01-22, 10:59:11 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll see if I can get a figure for solar & storage and approx cost to transport vehicles from friends
[2018-01-22, 10:59:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup. Have you talked to the realtor on the phone yet?
[2018-01-22, 10:59:39 AM] Jamie: That would be awesome. They have been for sale for a while so I don’t think there is any hurry
[2018-01-22, 10:59:59 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm tempted to cold call people at businesses across the inlet and ask their thoughts
[2018-01-22, 11:00:23 AM] Jamie: Nope, not yet bI am building a list of questions for her though.
[2018-01-22, 11:00:38 AM] Jamie: Their thoughts about what?
[2018-01-22, 11:00:49 AM] Rob Feeny: I want to get into a piece of land any way I can. I can't help much with a down payment but I can commit to payments and work-in-kind
[2018-01-22, 11:01:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Just thoughts on pricing, if there is anything you should know etc
[2018-01-22, 11:01:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Maybe they'll say to offer a lot less or that there's some crazy dude living on there
[2018-01-22, 11:01:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Questions are free!
[2018-01-22, 11:02:08 AM] Jamie: Haha true. Or the wells are shit or something.
[2018-01-22, 11:02:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh and I have my settlement coming soon so I could probably pull together 10k if I don't put it on my debts
[2018-01-22, 11:04:41 AM] Jamie: Yeah you have the skills to make this work, fo Baute
[2018-01-22, 11:04:44 AM] Jamie: Sure*
[2018-01-22, 11:05:36 AM] Rob Feeny: And if you need me to drive out and meet the realtor and Skype you over the phone that's an option
[2018-01-22, 11:05:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Due to a Fido fuck up I currently have 15gb of data a month for $60 😀
[2018-01-22, 11:08:18 AM] Jamie: Holy crap 15 gigs! Dude the internet here is so bad. No more than 4 mb/s
[2018-01-22, 11:08:38 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep, probably via celular?
[2018-01-22, 11:08:58 AM] Rob Feeny: Have you looked at your own internet stick? It was damn affordable in El Salvador
‎[2018-01-22, 11:09:23 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-01-22, 11:09:44 AM] Jamie: Possibly cellular. No I haven’t really needed it. Netflix works and I can still trade bitcoin
[2018-01-22, 11:10:27 AM] Rob Feeny: The great thing about internet down there is that when you "run out" of data it means you simply get slower data, not extra charges
[2018-01-22, 11:10:43 AM] Jamie: About the property, someone would definitely have to go take a look. It would be really expensive for me to fly back there to see it and then come back. And I’m not ready to come back yet, lol
[2018-01-22, 11:11:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah I get it.
[2018-01-23, 1:24:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Let me know if you want to chat on WhatsApp re: Tiny House plans
[2018-01-23, 1:44:51 PM] Jamie: Still trying to figure out the budget. Also, the real estate agent hasn’t responded yet.
[2018-01-23, 1:45:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm shame. It would honestly be great to talk to the developer. See how they got the well rig on there etc
[2018-01-23, 1:47:27 PM] Jamie: Yeah I have asked for a contact on the strata council too.  Seems like there would have to be one, even if it is operated by the developer in the early stages. I found only evidence of a wharf on one parcel valued at $1800, the communal dock valued at $32,500 and one has a building valued at $3800? No record of sales in the last 3 years and some are listed as vacant
[2018-01-23, 1:47:54 PM] Jamie: Trying to find out if it is the crown Selig it
[2018-01-23, 1:48:01 PM] Jamie: Selling*
[2018-01-23, 1:48:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm ok, would the crown go through the hassle of developing it with roads etc?
[2018-01-23, 1:49:36 PM] Jamie: Probably not. Good point. If a developer there must be some sort of plans for the island and I would like to know
[2018-01-23, 1:49:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha interesting, just googled wharf vs dock and it turns out what we call a dock is really a wharf or pier, the dock is the spot for the boat
[2018-01-23, 1:50:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I googled "Barge in Ucluelet" yesterday and didn't have much luck, was talking to a friend about costs
[2018-01-23, 1:50:30 PM] Rob Feeny: he says a barge & tug is about $300 an hour if it's local
[2018-01-23, 1:51:33 PM] Rob Feeny: So you could probably get everything there (if there's a local one) for $600 each way, based on 2 hours to load, get there, unload, then a trip back for the truck/excavator
[2018-01-23, 1:52:25 PM] Jamie: Hmmm ok... it’s possible that I would buy the land, then move to a city nearby (rent) to work for the extra money to build the tiny house. I would like to keep as much in my investments as possible.
[2018-01-23, 1:53:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah there would be a lot of planning work you could do while working
[2018-01-23, 1:53:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Set a date and work towards it
[2018-01-23, 1:53:31 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2018-01-23, 1:53:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Were you looking at trailers at Rewild or getting them to build it?
[2018-01-23, 1:54:31 PM] Jamie: Just found it and looked through the inventory etc to get an idea for prices. They may also be a source with info on how to get these things dropped in place, barge etc
[2018-01-23, 1:54:51 PM] Jamie: Looking for local to the island contact for services related...
[2018-01-23, 1:55:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah Westcoast did a lot of this stuff, we hauled cabins to gulf islands but not out there
[2018-01-23, 1:56:06 PM] Jamie: Yeah seemed like westcoast winged it most of the time, at the expense of the client, before you arrived.
[2018-01-23, 1:56:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, but they learned a lot in the process and I'm still friends with most of the staff that worked there in the past
[2018-01-23, 1:56:54 PM] Jamie: Ok great. You still working with tiny houses?
[2018-01-23, 1:57:01 PM] Jamie: Or with Morgan mostly?
[2018-01-23, 1:57:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I think there is only one single person who still works there, from my time, but I still have access to the body of knowledge, I still go for beers with those guys regularly
[2018-01-23, 1:57:35 PM] Rob Feeny: A mix. Today for Ben (Tiny Houses), yesterday with Morgan. Most of the income from Morgan though
[2018-01-23, 1:57:38 PM] Rob Feeny: maybe 70%
[2018-01-23, 2:01:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Just rebuilding my computer this AM
[2018-01-23, 2:09:51 PM] Jamie: Oh fuck. I wish. My keyboard and mouse have for much died I’m using a USB keyboard and mouse
[2018-01-23, 2:10:10 PM] Jamie: It’s super annoying but I can’t find the tools here to open it up
[2018-01-23, 2:10:21 PM] Rob Feeny: That sucks
[2018-01-23, 2:10:38 PM] Jamie: So if you have a set of pre made plans that you think would work for me, that would be really need to look at
[2018-01-23, 2:10:49 PM] Jamie: neat*
[2018-01-23, 2:12:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmmm damn, I personally don't, the designers usually hang onto them pretty tightly, sell them from anywhere from $300 to $3,000. I could get you a deal on any that friends have done, like Daniel who is doing my Tiny, I'll ask him what he has
[2018-01-23, 2:12:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Ever use Trello?
[2018-01-23, 2:14:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Depending on what you're looking for but most of the ones we end up doing are 26ft long, 8.5' wide, registered as RVs
[2018-01-23, 2:29:59 PM] Jamie: And how much do they weigh? Roughly?
[2018-01-23, 2:30:04 PM] Jamie: Thanks for the link
[2018-01-23, 2:30:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Mine is on target for about 13,000lbs
[2018-01-23, 2:30:53 PM] Rob Feeny: double axle
[2018-01-23, 2:31:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Don't think you could pull it with the Taco
[2018-01-23, 2:31:18 PM] Jamie: Haha so my truck will NOT tow this! 6000 pbs
[2018-01-23, 2:31:20 PM] Jamie: Lbs
[2018-01-23, 2:31:46 PM] Rob Feeny: You could do one, maybe a 20ft one designed to be light and hit 8,000?
[2018-01-23, 2:31:52 PM] Rob Feeny: They're not designed to move often
[2018-01-23, 2:32:11 PM] Jamie: Nah. There is not reason to ever move it again hopefully
[2018-01-23, 2:32:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah it's worth just renting a truck
[2018-02-13, 1:52:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Your old guy Kyle is on this site with us. Not the most dedicated worker is he?
[2018-02-13, 6:01:34 PM] Jamie: Haha which Kyle? The Asianish guy?
[2018-02-13, 6:01:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2018-02-13, 6:02:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Balsam electric
[2018-02-13, 6:02:26 PM] Jamie: Yeah. Actually he was great for a few months and then decided he didn’t want to work so hard, lol
[2018-02-14, 5:11:31 PM] Jamie: Very cool build
I built a Tiny House. Semi-permanent foundation. 28ft long. $20,000 to build.
https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/7xf2fs/i_built_a_tiny_house_semipermanent_foundation/?st=JDNMS4B4&sh=2df10227
[2018-02-14, 6:23:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Very cool. Nice and simple. Price isn't very realistic in your location tho
[2018-02-14, 6:23:39 PM] Rob Feeny: And that would technically be subject to building codes and inspections due to the size
[2018-02-14, 7:12:53 PM] Jamie: Really? What size is inspected as a factory built?
[2018-02-14, 7:13:22 PM] Rob Feeny: No, it's the fact that it's "semi permanent" and on stilts like that
[2018-02-14, 7:13:56 PM] Rob Feeny: The moment it's it's not wheels and set on the ground, over 10x10, it needs a permit
[2018-02-14, 7:13:59 PM] Jamie: Ahhh yeah I would want it on wheels. And the tile bathrooom probably wouldn’t last transit
[2018-02-14, 7:14:21 PM] Rob Feeny: We've actually done a couple in tile and they did pretty well. Some very minor cracking
[2018-02-14, 7:14:38 PM] Jamie: Good to know. How’s vancouver?
[2018-02-14, 7:14:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Used a semiflexible grout
[2018-02-14, 7:14:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Cold. Working outside too much but good otherwise
[2018-02-14, 7:15:57 PM] Rob Feeny: And Ecuador?
[2018-02-14, 7:18:48 PM] Jamie: It’s pretty good. Getting bored of the surface relationships of transient people though, lol
[2018-02-14, 7:19:26 PM] Jamie: But really shouldn’t complain. Getting good at surfing though!
[2018-02-14, 7:20:24 PM] Jamie: Making money?
[2018-02-14, 7:21:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm making some. Paying the bills and putting work into Supervans and other projects
[2018-02-14, 7:22:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha are there many long term people like you?
[2018-02-14, 7:29:08 PM] Jamie: Just the interns, lol. And I have met some locals which helps.
[2018-02-14, 7:33:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Interns?
[2018-02-14, 7:33:40 PM] Jamie: People that work at the school in exchange for free housing and Spanish lessons. They are 3 months-6 months
[2018-02-14, 7:35:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok ok
[2018-02-14, 7:35:22 PM] Rob Feeny: So you're turning into one of the longest erm residents
[2018-02-14, 7:36:10 PM] Jamie: Yup. I’m like the cat that lives here. Permanent but not contributing. Haha
[2018-02-14, 7:36:35 PM] Jamie: But I go to Columbia on feb 23rd for a week and then take a sailboat for 5 days to Panama
[2018-02-14, 7:36:47 PM] Jamie: And that’s it for Ecuador
[2018-02-14, 7:36:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Yikes.
[2018-02-14, 7:44:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Where is your next long term place?
[2018-02-14, 7:44:47 PM] Jamie: Costa Rica. Santa Teresa for the surfing. Quite a bit more expensive than here but hopefully I can live cheap
[2018-02-14, 7:45:10 PM] Jamie: You gonna find a place to get away for a week or two soon?
[2018-02-14, 7:47:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I was looking at Colombia and Ecuador but you are leaving and so is my friend Carol that I was going to visit
[2018-02-14, 7:48:16 PM] Rob Feeny: The $500 return flights to El Salvador are tempting
[2018-02-14, 7:52:15 PM] Jamie: Yeah it’s possible I will swing by Él Tuco on my way up to Guatemala and Mexico
[2018-02-14, 7:53:09 PM] Rob Feeny: You should check out Puerto Escondido in México
[2018-02-14, 7:59:31 PM] Jamie: I have heard of it for sure
[2018-02-16, 10:00:48 AM] Rob Feeny: So any updated on Kvarno? Just going to do some planning for my next month soon
[2018-02-16, 6:33:48 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob. It’s a tough one. I can’t buy it without seeing it and I am not ready to come back. That being said, if you want to go check it out I would pay your expenses. Getting your approval on the property might move my decision forward.
[2018-02-16, 6:34:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay I will take a look this weekend at my schedule and maybe give you a ring
[2018-02-16, 6:44:14 PM] Jamie: Sounds good. Thanks man
[2018-02-16, 10:14:38 PM] Rob Feeny: So I finally have all my business finances running through an accounting suite and it's quite interesting.
[2018-02-16, 10:14:50 PM] Rob Feeny: I get why you were always tinkering with it
[2018-02-16, 10:15:19 PM] Jamie: Haha it can be a black hole of time but I found it enlightening. What program?
[2018-02-16, 10:15:38 PM] Rob Feeny: It's an online one called Zoho
[2018-02-16, 10:15:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Super user friendly, $7 a month
[2018-02-16, 10:15:56 PM] Jamie: And what kind of data or reports are you getting back?
[2018-02-16, 10:16:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Got my friend in Brazil doing all the data entry
[2018-02-16, 10:16:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Just now able to see what I spend on fuel, or how my income split it between consulting and contracting
[2018-02-16, 10:16:51 PM] Jamie: Fuel is always handy to know.
[2018-02-16, 10:17:14 PM] Rob Feeny: And it's nice to know exactly how much income tax to set aside and GST
[2018-02-16, 10:17:45 PM] Jamie: Totally. What’s your biggest expense?
[2018-02-16, 10:17:35 PM] Rob Feeny: I've only got 2 months of data to play with so far
[2018-02-16, 10:18:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Totally my vehicle. Between insurance, fuel and maintenance, it's huge
[2018-02-16, 10:18:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Fucking jobs out in Kerrisdale are killing me
[2018-02-16, 10:19:33 PM] Jamie: Yeah I was paying a thousand a month for fuel alone to drive to that side of the city
[2018-02-16, 10:19:42 PM] Rob Feeny: I think I'm going to get my own WorkSafe coverage and then bump my rate with Morgan because I'm using my own tools and vehicle a lot of the time now
[2018-02-16, 10:19:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap. Well Gas is $1.47/L now
[2018-02-18, 3:08:37 PM] Rob Feeny: When are you going to be in Panama?
[2018-02-18, 3:11:03 PM] Rob Feeny: March 1 to 15th in Panama, $474 😬
[2018-02-18, 5:41:25 PM] Jamie: I’m only in Panama for 2 days. The 9th to the 11th
[2018-02-18, 5:41:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok. Doing a tour of the Caribbean?
[2018-02-18, 5:43:11 PM] Jamie: I am in Cartagena, Colombia from the 24th to the 4th, then I take a sailboat from there to the San Blas Islands and the to Panama. Then from Panama to Costa Rica
[2018-02-18, 5:43:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Sounds amazing
[2018-02-18, 5:44:18 PM] Jamie: Yeah sorry I’m such a moving target, lol
[2018-02-21, 11:50:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok headed to Puerto Vallarta in  couple weeks.
[2018-02-21, 11:51:21 AM] Jamie: Nice! That will be good for you
[2018-02-21, 11:51:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep, little sanity break in some small town on the coast. Got loads to do online so I'll just sit in a restaurant or hostel working
[2018-02-21, 11:51:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Better than Starbucks!
[2018-02-21, 11:52:14 AM] Jamie: True! And practise your Spanish
[2018-02-21, 11:52:46 AM] Rob Feeny: When I get back I could take a trip out to Ucluelet if you have sufficient interest. Honestly I'd do anything to buy in on some land so any expenses I'd rather just contribute to a share in it if it's an option
[2018-02-21, 11:53:13 AM] Rob Feeny: I practice my Spanish pretty much every day anyhow but it'll be nice to get out of the cold and immerse myself
[2018-02-21, 11:55:00 AM] Jamie: I am still interested. Very. Just need more info and I need to have a plan for some income while I get it set up
[2018-02-21, 11:55:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay well we can touch base later on
[2018-02-21, 11:55:44 AM] Rob Feeny: I'd probably just combine it with a trip to Victoria to see my friend Hailee
[2018-02-21, 11:56:44 AM] Jamie: That sounds perfect. I wonder if we can rent a drone or something so I can see some better footage? It would be nice to get a sense of the size of the property
[2018-02-21, 11:56:59 AM] Jamie: Also the distance (boat time) to the mainland dock
[2018-02-21, 11:57:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm interesting idea
[2018-02-21, 11:57:29 AM] Rob Feeny: I'd take lots of video
[2018-02-23, 12:12:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I thought I recognized the keypads. That's the system you said they wanted because a friend was repping it or something? And it was terrible?
[2018-02-23, 12:15:03 PM] Jamie: Well it’s beautiful. But problematic and non logical to me. And other than a guy in Kelowna I was the only guy that could program
[2018-02-23, 12:20:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Well maybe you'll be doing some remotely?
[2018-02-23, 12:20:27 PM] Jamie: Oh god I hope not, lol. Maybe though I would like to know it better
[2018-02-23, 12:20:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha it seems Rolando knows it and he's helping with this job
‎[2018-02-23, 12:20:51 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-02-23, 12:20:55 PM] Rob Feeny: He says hey
[2018-02-23, 12:21:04 PM] Jamie: Haha hey dude!
[2018-02-25, 3:32:07 PM] Jamie: Sounds like kvarno Island is zoned for medical marijuana growing, lol
[2018-02-25, 3:32:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha read that document hey?
[2018-02-25, 3:39:32 PM] Jamie: Yeah
[2018-03-02, 12:14:27 AM] Rob Feeny: So do we need to send these T4 copies anywhere or just sit on them?
[2018-03-12, 2:38:59 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob they will need to be mailed out. Feel like forging my signature, lol?
[2018-03-12, 2:39:13 PM] Jamie: At least one of the addresses has changed.
[2018-03-12, 2:54:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha Dan has them, I'm actually in Mexico but we were talking about it and I just messaged you then
[2018-03-12, 2:55:33 PM] Jamie: No problem. I’ll reach out to him. How the beach life?
[2018-03-12, 3:06:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Pretty decent
[2018-03-12, 3:06:25 PM] Rob Feeny: This place is packed with gringos but it's a nice little town
[2018-03-12, 3:06:38 PM] Rob Feeny: And where are you now?
[2018-03-12, 3:24:22 PM] Jamie: Just got to Santa Teresa beach in Costa Rica. Beautiful waves, hot women by probably 3-4 tines the cost of Ecuador. 😕
[2018-03-12, 3:24:42 PM] Jamie: I sent you an email re the island if you have some time to think down there.
[2018-03-12, 3:24:45 PM] Jamie: You surfing?
[2018-03-12, 3:36:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh that sucks. It's a bit like that here, everything is expensive.
[2018-03-12, 3:37:03 PM] Rob Feeny: A margarita is $5 and a beer in a bar is about $3.50. probably twice the price is southern Mexico
[2018-03-12, 3:37:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Just replied to the email
[2018-03-12, 3:37:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope, still recovering from a knee injury from the beginning of the year. Physio said no. Running, swimming, yoga
[2018-03-15, 12:41:16 PM] Jamie: Hey when you get back can I use your number for 2FA on my Td US bank account?
[2018-03-15, 12:42:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2018-03-15, 12:42:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I have my Canadian SIM here in my phone if needed, just tell me when and I'll activate it
[2018-03-19, 11:54:25 AM] Jamie: Hey man we might go surf in on Él Salvador. Where should we go?
[2018-03-19, 12:10:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Probably El Tunco Is a good base, but there is also zonte, km 57 and Mizunte
[2018-03-19, 12:11:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I can connect you with Derek who has a development in El Zonte and would be a great source
[2018-03-19, 12:20:41 PM] Jamie: Sure that would be helpful
[2018-03-19, 12:21:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Plus I think my friend Silvia is friends with 90% of the local surfers. Just at the beach, I'll connect you later today
[2018-03-19, 12:26:33 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2018-03-20, 3:06:32 PM] Jamie: Hey what’s biggest dimensions on a THOW in Bc?  Also what software did you use to design?
[2018-03-20, 3:09:57 PM] Rob Feeny: I did it on paper, then Ben played around with it in SketchUp for me, when we were together
[2018-03-20, 3:10:06 PM] Rob Feeny: The actual design is being done in CAD
[2018-03-20, 3:10:13 PM] Rob Feeny: By a designer
[2018-03-20, 3:10:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Max is 8'6" wide x 57' long but we usually use 26' long
[2018-03-20, 3:11:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Interior space Is usually just over 7' wide
[2018-03-20, 3:11:35 PM] Rob Feeny: I can send you a worksheet to walk you through some choices and a printable layout and cutouts that I designed if you want
[2018-03-20, 3:12:19 PM] Jamie: Got it. And height is 13’6”? Seems like Sketch up is free. Yes please send me those. Thanks!
[2018-03-20, 3:13:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Max height is 13'6", trailer deck height is 22" but we use 24" for a margin
[2018-03-20, 3:18:04 PM] Jamie: Ok. I think I will try to use the software I used for my condo first just to get started
[2018-03-22, 11:05:06 AM] Jamie: How’s your melon?
[2018-03-22, 11:06:10 AM] Rob Feeny: Pretty sore. Think I've got some whiplash
[2018-03-22, 11:06:27 AM] Jamie: Shitty. An impact to your head?
‎[2018-03-22, 11:06:35 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-03-22, 11:06:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Dove through a wave, found a sandbar
[2018-03-22, 11:07:00 AM] Rob Feeny: Head hurts, neck hurts. Hope it doesn't scar...
[2018-03-22, 11:07:08 AM] Jamie: That sucks. I thought maybe you got tossed onto shore
[2018-03-22, 11:07:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha I had a similar mark that lasted a few days for exactly that reason
[2018-03-22, 11:07:36 AM] Rob Feeny: They were pretty huge waves
[2018-03-22, 11:07:54 AM] Jamie: Fun otherwise?  And nice ‘stache
[2018-03-22, 11:07:57 AM] Rob Feeny: I have been swimming in the same spot for 2 weeks, but the big waves reshaped the ocean floor
[2018-03-22, 11:08:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup chill place, lots of gringos but a nice vibe
[2018-03-22, 11:08:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Where are you now?
[2018-03-22, 11:09:12 AM] Jamie: Still Costa Rica. We go to Nicaragua on Sunday. This place has great waves but it’s boring. No centro, one long 4 km road so no main gathering place
[2018-03-22, 11:09:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh yah that's similar to San Pancho
[2018-03-22, 11:10:31 AM] Rob Feeny: But it's small enough (about 1 k) that people and restaurants cluster at the end near the beach
[2018-03-22, 11:10:43 AM] Rob Feeny: How long are you sticking there?
[2018-03-22, 11:19:14 AM] Jamie: Maybe a couple weeks. Depends on the waves and the vibe. I would’ve thought we’d stay here longer but I don’t like it
[2018-03-22, 11:20:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. And does semana santa craziness start tomorrow?
[2018-03-22, 11:26:49 AM] Jamie: Don’t know
[2018-03-22, 11:27:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah do you have something booked? Might be busy. All of Latin America starts about 9 days of vacation tomorrow afternoon
[2018-03-22, 11:28:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Really it's only wed next week to the following Monday but lots of people combine it with the first weekend
[2018-03-22, 1:04:17 PM] Jamie: Yeah we managed. Couldn’t get into the place we wanted but found rooms at another spot we had our eye one.
[2018-03-22, 1:04:26 PM] Jamie: on*
[2018-03-22, 1:04:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok good to hear
[2018-03-22, 1:18:57 PM] Jamie: I guess lot 12 sold for $133,000 in February. Slightly over list. Trying to find out more info about lot 9 but my real estate agent is not being very responsive.
[2018-03-22, 1:19:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah shit. Want me to call her when I get home?
[2018-03-22, 1:20:26 PM] Jamie: Yeah probably a good idea. I send her a message each morning. She fired off a quick email but with info about 12 not 9 like I asked. Then no response.
[2018-03-23, 3:17:47 PM] Jamie: For the loft floor, do you keep an 8’ ceiling under it?
[2018-03-23, 3:18:29 PM] Rob Feeny: No, usually about 6'6"
[2018-03-23, 3:18:40 PM] Jamie: Seems like after 2’ for the trailer, 8’ and 1.5” for floors, I only have about 3’
[2018-03-23, 3:18:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Then there's the thickness of beams and floor above
[2018-03-23, 3:18:43 PM] Jamie: Ahhh ok
[2018-03-23, 3:18:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Gimme a minute and I think can send you an example
‎[2018-03-23, 3:19:39 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-03-23, 3:20:08 PM] Jamie: Got it. Thx
[2018-03-23, 3:20:14 PM] Rob Feeny: So here Daniel has put 6' to the bottom of the beams
‎[2018-03-23, 3:20:30 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-03-23, 3:20:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Here's how my beams will run so in most of the hallway you get 6'4"
[2018-03-23, 7:54:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey did you ever reply to Derek on FB? He's the guy whose wedding I went to down in El Salvador
[2018-03-23, 7:55:50 PM] Jamie: Nope. Not yet. We have only planned the Nicaragua portion so far. Organizing 3 people is much more difficult, lol
[2018-03-23, 7:56:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet. I shut down FB again so I wanted to check
[2018-03-25, 11:44:48 AM] Jamie: How’s the face doing?
‎[2018-03-25, 11:46:13 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-03-25, 11:46:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Getting better. I did a yoga class and workout and it actually helped a lot, because the scab got saturated and cracked and released a lot of pressure
[2018-03-25, 11:46:54 AM] Rob Feeny: It's healing fast
[2018-03-25, 11:46:59 AM] Rob Feeny: How's Costa Rica?
[2018-03-25, 11:47:35 AM] Jamie: Yeah at least it’s not deep.
[2018-03-25, 11:48:33 AM] Jamie: Costa Rica was good but now we are on our way to Nicaragua by shuttle
[2018-03-25, 11:48:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Ah nice. What part?
[2018-03-25, 11:49:06 AM] Jamie: Playa Maderas to start and then working north
[2018-03-25, 11:49:09 AM] Rob Feeny: BTW I'm planning on calling the realtor Monday morning to chat
[2018-03-25, 11:49:37 AM] Jamie: Ok sounds good.
[2018-03-25, 11:49:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmm looks cool
[2018-03-25, 11:49:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Ever used Trello?
[2018-03-25, 11:49:59 AM] Jamie: Yeah a while back
[2018-03-25, 11:50:09 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm looking for a place to start collecting Kvarno data together
[2018-03-25, 11:51:48 AM] Jamie: Sure let’s try that. Did you see the info my realtor sent?
[2018-03-25, 11:53:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup, read through it but need to take some time to process. I think #9 was the one we decided was better anyway
[2018-03-25, 12:05:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Monday morning I'm going to organize a Trello board into what we know and what we still need to find out.
[2018-03-25, 12:06:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet there's a surf photographer in Ucluelet or Tofino we could pay to do a flyover from shore
[2018-03-26, 1:24:39 PM] Rob Feeny: So is Marla Tomm the realtor you would be using then?
[2018-03-26, 1:24:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Just about to call her and Kelly
[2018-03-26, 1:28:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey I can't find any number for Marla nor does she show up on any Google searches for her name, Ucluelet, realtor etc. Is she the lady you want to work with, because the other (Judy gray) doesn't respond?
[2018-03-26, 1:33:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Anyhow, I emailed her and texted Kelly, we'll see who's available
[2018-03-26, 1:34:21 PM] Rob Feeny: The Trello board is partial updated. Feel free to rearrange, organize, add and update with whatever you have
[2018-03-26, 5:19:52 PM] Jamie: Marla is the realtor that I used to buy and sell my house. Mostly I wanted the info she could get us about the assessments.  Her last name is about 15 letter so she shortens it
[2018-03-26, 5:23:58 PM] Jamie: Is there a link for the trello?
[2018-03-26, 5:24:14 PM] Rob Feeny: You should have gotten an email?
[2018-03-26, 5:25:30 PM] Jamie: Got copied on an email to Marla, not Kelly and no trello
[2018-03-26, 5:25:54 PM] Rob Feeny: k gimme a few min, supervans stuff. Rolando says Hi
[2018-03-26, 5:26:27 PM] Jamie: No hurry. Sup Rolando!
[2018-03-26, 5:30:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Join my Trello Board! https://trello.com/invite/b/BTLoZiWG/29f4e193ef8b85631306f1e1bdfd1126/kvarno-island-info
[2018-03-26, 5:31:17 PM] Rob Feeny: No email to Kelly, I called and texted, he doesn't really seem like the email type
[2018-03-26, 5:31:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok that makes more sense. I thought she was a local realtor
[2018-03-26, 5:32:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I would contact the local realtor as well then after talking to her
[2018-03-26, 5:33:36 PM] Jamie: Yeah makes sense. Marla is a ferocious negotiator so I thought someone not emotionally attached to the purchase might get a better deal for use. Seller pays the realtor fees so it costs us nothing...
[2018-03-26, 5:40:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok great. I'll talk to her, then contact the local realtor and them confirm with Kelly, he says he's around.
[2018-03-26, 5:41:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Looked at costs, just missed a flight sale that would have gotten me there and back for $150 :(
[2018-03-26, 5:41:52 PM] Jamie: Will Kelly be willing to take you to the island in his boat?
[2018-03-26, 5:42:10 PM] Jamie: And no vehicle on the island side though? Ha transit probably sucks
[2018-03-26, 5:45:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Haven't sorted that yet. Was just going to hitchhike, it's Tofino! Haha but I'll drive, try to get some ride share ppl and visit Hailee in Victoria along the way
[2018-03-26, 5:45:39 PM] Jamie: Sounds like an adventure. Wish I could go, that’s for sure
[2018-03-26, 5:46:09 PM] Rob Feeny: I've put some of the costs in Trello, let me know if you get it up and running
[2018-03-26, 5:49:16 PM] Jamie: Didn’t see any costs. I have it up now and looking at the notes
[2018-03-26, 5:50:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Just on the trip planning, not much info yet, but probably $80 gas, $30 hostel, $150 Ferry (!?)
[2018-03-26, 5:53:47 PM] Jamie: I see it
[2018-03-26, 5:54:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha now that I'm looking it's less info than I remember
[2018-03-26, 5:54:24 PM] Rob Feeny: I will tweak that board more tonight
[2018-03-26, 5:55:12 PM] Jamie: All good. I have a basic design for my tiny house, just figuring out how to send it to you in the next day or two
[2018-03-26, 6:12:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sweet, I can show it to the designers on Thursday at climbing
[2018-03-27, 10:58:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Tiny looks good, nice and clean. Did you go with 10.5' wide?
[2018-03-27, 10:58:59 AM] Rob Feeny: That's an option, but does increase your costs a fair bit, it needs to be transported by a professional transport company plus is harder to certify. But the extra 2ft is amazing
[2018-03-27, 11:00:23 AM] Rob Feeny: A couple of points, the wood stove needs more clearance, check my Trello Board (I think I invited you in the past) it has the info about 2 small stoves under "appliances"
[2018-03-27, 11:01:17 AM] Rob Feeny: And your stove needs a range hood above it, that will conflict with your window. You could do an induction cooktop instead but anything gas needs the range hood
[2018-03-27, 11:01:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Any idea what kind of roof? I'd suggest a shed roof with the high side above your stairs
[2018-03-27, 11:14:58 AM] Jamie: Ok good advice. I moved the stove under the loft so the sink has the few out the window and for the hood fan to go.
[2018-03-27, 11:15:21 AM] Jamie: I want gas stove for sure and no thoughts on a roof yet.
[2018-03-27, 11:15:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok and we can pop a gas line out the wall to the BBQ if wanted. Or a tank is easy and cheap
[2018-03-27, 11:16:37 AM] Jamie: Didn’t go 10’, it’s the dimensions we talked about earlier
[2018-03-27, 11:17:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Really? Seems really roomy for that. 7' interior wall to wall?
[2018-03-27, 11:18:04 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll look at it on my laptop later today
[2018-03-27, 11:18:51 AM] Jamie: I would imagine the walls are standard walls that the program generates. What should exterior walls be?
[2018-03-27, 11:20:46 AM] Rob Feeny: They're 2x4 framing, but with that, interior boarding, exterior cladding, rainscreen and siding, we basically dedicate 6"
[2018-03-27, 11:21:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Plus 3" for roof overhang, vents and sills means that 2 walls and 2x3" takes 1.5' off the 8.5' max width
[2018-03-27, 11:21:39 AM] Rob Feeny: So you can work with 7' interior wall to wall
[2018-03-27, 11:21:48 AM] Jamie: Yikes. Ok good to know
[2018-03-27, 11:22:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Did you check with that worksheet I sent you?
[2018-03-27, 11:23:16 AM] Rob Feeny: I just tried to add you to my tiny house Trello board but I'm not sure if the Trello ID I have for you uses your old email address
[2018-03-27, 11:23:53 AM] Rob Feeny: There's a ton of that you can use
[2018-03-27, 11:24:08 AM] Jamie: You added me to one already and it worked. Email is Feeny.jamie@gmail.com
[2018-03-27, 11:24:43 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll manually add you again, might get 2 invites
[2018-03-28, 10:11:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok I think all data except our agreement is in Trello, if you have more, can you add it?
[2018-03-28, 11:30:13 AM] Jamie: Yeah we just have our conversations really. I can grab the text and paste it all into a doc for now. Updating the tiny designs too
[2018-03-28, 11:30:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Cool
[2018-03-28, 3:21:16 PM] Jamie: Hey you back in Canada?
[2018-03-28, 3:23:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2018-03-28, 3:24:01 PM] Jamie: My bank has blocked online banking j TIL I set up 2FA to text. No other options. Can I use your number to send the code?
[2018-03-28, 3:24:09 PM] Rob Feeny: For sure
[2018-03-28, 3:30:32 PM] Jamie: K should get a code
[2018-03-28, 3:34:18 PM] Rob Feeny: 907480 then 642360
[2018-03-28, 3:34:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Got two
[2018-03-28, 3:35:42 PM] Jamie: Worked. Unfortunately that’s every time I need to log in, maybe a couple times a month
[2018-03-28, 3:35:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha no worries
[2018-03-28, 3:38:06 PM] Jamie: Ok another one. Scotia and TD are forcing it
‎[2018-03-28, 3:39:05 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-03-28, 3:39:30 PM] Rob Feeny: They make an international sim for just texting and whatsapp I think
[2018-03-28, 3:46:14 PM] Jamie: From who? Everything here expires after 7 or 30 days
[2018-03-28, 3:50:08 PM] Rob Feeny: https://www.mobal.com/international-gsm-sim-card/
[2018-03-28, 3:50:15 PM] Rob Feeny: All incoming texts are free
[2018-03-28, 3:50:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Never expires. No chance of data tho
[2018-03-28, 3:52:13 PM] Jamie: Hmmm looks cool. Don’t see anything about outgoing texts costing money though
[2018-03-28, 3:52:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Changes per country. Some I looked at were 80c each but hey you only need incoming
[2018-03-28, 3:53:03 PM] Rob Feeny: They also make data only sim cards. Slow data everywhere unlimited for a set fee
[2018-03-28, 3:53:57 PM] Jamie: Haha it’s cheaper to use my bell account - $1 a minute I think
[2018-03-28, 3:54:25 PM] Jamie: I’m happy without a sim. Annoying sometimes but...
[2018-03-28, 3:55:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh you still have it? Can't you send texts to that?
[2018-03-28, 3:55:57 PM] Jamie: No I did end up canceling it a few weeks ago
[2018-03-28, 3:56:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. The benefit of that one is you can just leave it off until you need if, for no cost
[2018-03-29, 1:38:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Realtor wasn't much use but did give me info on a restricted archeological site attached to Lot 9, approx 60m x 20m
[2018-03-29, 1:58:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok lots more info in Trello on restrictions such as no building within 30m of shore or changing of vegetation within 15m. Docs uploaded
[2018-03-29, 1:58:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks like it was owned by a logging company, they didn't pay taxes, it went back to the government and then a numbered Corp bought it and subdivided it.
[2018-04-02, 10:12:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Is that you with quick books?
[2018-04-02, 10:12:22 AM] Jamie: Hey can you send me a code if it comes?
[2018-04-02, 10:12:24 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2018-04-02, 10:12:30 AM] Rob Feeny: 559202
[2018-04-02, 10:13:24 AM] Jamie: Thx. Trying to backup my QBO and kill the subscription for now.
[2018-04-02, 10:14:01 AM] Jamie: Need to figure out if I should close FPC and just start a new corp eventually. Not sure what value but costs money to maintain
[2018-04-02, 10:14:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah it's probably a couple grand a year isn't it?
[2018-04-02, 10:15:27 AM] Jamie: Well $450 with no activity but lots of filing obligations.  Gst, PST, annual filing. Paying my accountant to do the forms and the lawyer to file it. And paying $50 a month for QBO
[2018-04-02, 10:16:12 AM] Jamie: And it will be a fair bit of work to update the QBO with the last 5 months of expenses. But I guess I should figure it out.
[2018-04-02, 10:19:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Look at reducing your qbo package. If you're not using a lot of the features anymore you could downgrade..
[2018-04-02, 10:19:29 AM] Rob Feeny: The basic online accounting suite I used costs me $7 a month
[2018-04-02, 10:19:35 AM] Jamie: I don’t think you can. I called them before I left.
[2018-04-02, 10:19:55 AM] Jamie: Because I had inventory and employees.
[2018-04-02, 10:20:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahh shitty. With Zoho you start out with basic but add on things like timesheets, inventory, bills vs expenses etc
[2018-04-02, 10:20:20 AM] Jamie: But I heard now you can back up the file which you could not do before.
[2018-04-02, 10:20:53 AM] Jamie: Yeah that’s part of why I want to close the Corp. I can run so much more lean with new software etc. QBO is big and clunky.
[2018-04-02, 10:22:42 AM] Jamie: Need to find someone to give me advice on keeping the Corp or not. Know anyone?
[2018-04-02, 10:22:51 AM] Jamie: I will look at Zoho
[2018-04-02, 10:24:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm let me ask my friend Anjie
[2018-04-02, 10:25:30 AM] Jamie: That would be great
[2018-04-02, 10:32:20 AM] Jamie: Getting excited about the trip next weekend?
[2018-04-02, 10:34:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah, my friend Hailee in Victoria is actually going to join me now
[2018-04-02, 10:34:19 AM] Rob Feeny: So the drive will be nice
[2018-04-02, 10:35:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Sadly gas is also expected to hit 1.60 a little but c'est la vie
[2018-04-02, 10:55:47 AM] Jamie: Jesus
[2018-04-03, 11:37:10 AM] Jamie: Hey Rob. Do you think you could forge my signature on the T4s and mail them?
[2018-04-03, 11:37:28 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah I suppose
[2018-04-03, 11:37:35 AM] Jamie: Appreciate it.
[2018-04-03, 11:37:35 AM] Rob Feeny: Wouldn't be the first time
[2018-04-03, 11:37:39 AM] Jamie: Lol
[2018-04-03, 11:37:49 AM] Jamie: I think there is one address change
[2018-04-03, 11:37:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Good thing you gave me all your stamps and envelopes when you left
[2018-04-03, 11:50:20 AM] Jamie: So Michelle Corrin’s new address is
[2018-04-03, 11:50:23 AM] Jamie: 20152 69 ave, Langley V2y 2y2
[2018-04-03, 11:50:54 AM] Jamie: One signed copy goes to the government and the others to the employees. Thanks Rob
[2018-04-04, 1:24:06 PM] Rob Feeny: 921610
[2018-04-04, 1:24:10 PM] Jamie: The
[2018-04-04, 1:24:12 PM] Jamie: Thx
‎[2018-04-05, 11:09:41 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-04-05, 11:10:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Realized halfway through that I could just stick a stamp on the whole thing without an envelope
[2018-04-05, 11:11:28 AM] Jamie: Haha perfect. Appreciate this Rob. Slowly cleaning up the last details
[2018-04-05, 11:11:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Poco a poco
[2018-04-05, 11:14:22 AM] Rob Feeny: There's a summary sheet and copies of the T4s for you. Do you need them or have that in digital form already?
[2018-04-05, 11:15:03 AM] Jamie: Yeah just toss them in an envelope and throw it in my filing box
[2018-04-05, 11:15:14 AM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2018-04-05, 11:17:20 AM] Jamie: Just cancelled my QuickBooks online which was $50 a month. That felt good. I get 12 months of read only / export only access and can renew the subscription if I want and get all data back for 24 months.
[2018-04-05, 11:17:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Beauty. Did you download a copy of the info? The whole 7yrs thing
[2018-04-05, 11:18:10 AM] Jamie: Just 2 more bank accounts costing me $30 and $20 a month to get rid of and then my expenses are almost nothing
[2018-04-05, 11:18:32 AM] Jamie: Just the condo in Calgary costing me $500 a month!
[2018-04-05, 11:18:49 AM] Jamie: Yeah my accountant have it
[2018-04-05, 11:19:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. That's a tough one
[2018-04-05, 11:19:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Are you still upside down on it?
[2018-04-05, 11:20:50 AM] Jamie: I could probably sell it and I would have to give all the equity to a realtor.
[2018-04-05, 11:21:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Crap. Tough call
[2018-04-05, 11:21:23 AM] Jamie: My mortgage is still going down by $5000 a year but it hurts my monthly expenses.
[2018-04-05, 11:21:40 AM] Jamie: May have to try to raise the rent by $100 a month.
[2018-04-05, 11:29:41 AM] Jamie: How’s your place?
[2018-04-05, 11:30:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Good, had a Mexican party on Saturday, cleaned it obsessively then it got dirty again haha
[2018-04-05, 11:30:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Haven't changed much lately, been busy but I want to do the laundry room soon
[2018-04-05, 11:30:55 AM] Jamie: Nice. Good turnout?
[2018-04-05, 11:31:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah maybe 16ppl?
[2018-04-05, 11:31:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Good for the size of my place
[2018-04-05, 11:31:26 AM] Jamie: Totally. Looks way better than before
[2018-04-05, 11:31:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Even Dan, Janice and the girls were over
[2018-04-05, 11:32:20 AM] Jamie: That’s cool
[2018-04-05, 11:33:34 AM] Rob Feeny: Just working on Dan to pay for the flooring materials for the kitchen, entrance and laundry room
[2018-04-05, 11:33:53 AM] Rob Feeny: The exterior of the house is getting done in June so he doesn't want to pay any more
[2018-04-05, 11:34:27 AM] Jamie: He never wants to pay haha. But slowly but surely that house is shaping up. Except for Anna’s side
[2018-04-05, 11:35:35 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh man
[2018-04-05, 11:35:38 AM] Rob Feeny: Anna.
[2018-04-05, 11:35:55 AM] Rob Feeny: I got everyone out doing yard work for half a day tho, that helped a lot
[2018-04-05, 11:36:10 AM] Jamie: Even her?
[2018-04-05, 11:36:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2018-04-05, 11:36:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Even elex
[2018-04-05, 11:39:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Still in playa madera?
[2018-04-05, 11:39:33 AM] Jamie: Nope. In Popoyo, Nicaragua.
[2018-04-05, 11:40:02 AM] Jamie: Had to have a hard conversation with the couple I have been travelling with and I am going my own way on Sunday.
[2018-04-05, 11:40:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh yah? What happened?
[2018-04-05, 11:41:24 AM] Jamie: Nothing really. They are in the honeymoon phase (met 3 months ago in Ecuador) and are spending money like its water. They also want more remote resorts
[2018-04-05, 11:42:14 AM] Jamie: My budget is $25 a night for a hostel, I am paying $42 right now and the next place is $56. And both are really remote.
[2018-04-05, 11:42:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh the "we don't need anyone else but eachother" phase
[2018-04-05, 11:43:06 AM] Jamie: They are rich Swiss kids. Dropping $15-$30 a day after breakfast at the store on pop, chips, chocolate bars etc
[2018-04-05, 11:43:33 AM] Jamie: Each meal at a restaurant they get wine, smoothie and a coke or two each.
[2018-04-05, 11:43:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Ah yes and their money goes further. Sounds like the Norwegians
[2018-04-05, 11:44:00 AM] Jamie: Lol it’s hilarious but they have no limit on their spending
[2018-04-05, 11:44:46 AM] Jamie: And honestly being in a remote location with a couple in this stage of their relationship is kind of annoying.
[2018-04-05, 11:46:07 AM] Jamie: I was getting anxious about the spending so I am gonna head to San Juan del sur for a week and then back to Costa Rica. Staying in a dorm st the most popular hostel in Santa Teresa.
[2018-04-05, 11:49:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha nothing like being the constant 3rd wheel
[2018-04-05, 11:50:27 AM] Jamie: Yeah. And they speak Swiss German to each other which is kinda rude when we are together but easiest for them
[2018-04-06, 6:24:16 PM] Jamie: Getting excited about seeing the island tomorrow?
[2018-04-06, 6:45:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, but rushing my ass to finish work and hit the ferry
[2018-04-06, 6:46:36 PM] Jamie: Morgan? Lol
[2018-04-06, 6:47:05 PM] Rob Feeny: No, it was me underestimating how long it would take to paint something
[2018-04-06, 6:47:11 PM] Rob Feeny: But it's for Morgan's client
[2018-04-06, 6:47:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I had all day. My bad.
[2018-04-06, 6:47:24 PM] Jamie: Ahhhh. Lol
[2018-04-07, 4:50:46 PM] Jamie: Did you make the ferry?
[2018-04-07, 4:50:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup I'm in Tofino
[2018-04-07, 4:51:01 PM] Jamie: Nice!
[2018-04-07, 4:51:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Just having a coffee, dropped off a nice Quebecois girl here then heading to Ukie
[2018-04-07, 4:51:44 PM] Rob Feeny: How's down south? It's cold rainy and shitty here but victoria was beautiful
[2018-04-07, 4:52:21 PM] Jamie: It’s been sunny for the last month solid in Costa Rica and Nicaragua.
[2018-04-07, 4:52:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Bastard!
[2018-04-07, 4:52:35 PM] Jamie: What time do you meet Kelly?
[2018-04-07, 4:52:43 PM] Rob Feeny: I went tanning the other day because I was so sick of the gloom
[2018-04-07, 4:52:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Tomorrow at 8am
[2018-04-07, 4:53:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I've got from 8 to 2 to spend on the island
[2018-04-07, 4:53:07 PM] Jamie: Staying in ucluelet?
[2018-04-07, 4:53:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah at the hostel. Brought a tent but it's still raining so...
[2018-04-07, 4:53:47 PM] Jamie: Hey while you are there can you confirm prices and availability at the marina? That probably where you will meet Kelly, right?
[2018-04-07, 4:54:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. I'll add it to my list.
[2018-04-07, 4:56:58 PM] Jamie: Sweet. I sure am curious as to what it will be like
[2018-04-07, 4:58:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Me too. I'm going to go explore Ucluelet a bit soon
[2018-04-07, 5:05:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Anything else you're interested in knowing.
[2018-04-07, 5:05:28 PM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2018-04-07, 5:07:13 PM] Jamie: How far is the well from the 2 ideal locations?
[2018-04-07, 5:07:29 PM] Jamie: Mostly just the gut feeling if the property is awesome or not
[2018-04-07, 5:08:11 PM] Jamie: If you were sitting on the deck of a tiny house looking at the ocean, does it feel like beautiful oceanfront property
[2018-04-07, 5:08:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I've got flagging tape and marking paint, I'm going to try to mark out where the no-build line is for photos
[2018-04-07, 5:08:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Got my laser level to to try and see the 4m mark
[2018-04-07, 5:09:05 PM] Jamie: Nice!  Haha I figured you would be prepared.
[2018-04-07, 5:09:59 PM] Rob Feeny: I want to get an idea about what parts of the lot are actually usable. 4m up is a lot of the land, so is 30m back
[2018-04-07, 5:10:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I've got my reel tape
[2018-04-07, 5:10:36 PM] Rob Feeny: And I will see lot 12 and pump Kelly for info on what it would cost to upgrade 9 to the same level
[2018-04-07, 5:10:56 PM] Jamie: Cool. Plus the archeological space we can’t use
[2018-04-07, 5:11:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Got a shovel too to see if it's all rock
[2018-04-07, 7:12:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Just spent an hour trying to climb a 'mountain' that overlooks Kvarno but no luck, it never opened up for a view, the trees were too thick

[2018-04-07, 7:14:43 PM] Jamie: Haha I would like to smoke a joint there, maybe drink a beer
[2018-04-07, 7:16:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah there's the wrecked remains of a couch and it's spray painted "sofa in the sky"
[2018-04-07, 7:16:26 PM] Jamie: Haha hippies
[2018-04-07, 7:16:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd call it drunk local kids
[2018-04-08, 11:49:08 AM] Rob Feeny: How's Costa Rica? Island is quite something
[2018-04-08, 11:49:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Anywhere with a signal?
[2018-04-08, 11:49:54 AM] Jamie: Yeah I’m at a coffee shop. Still in Nicaragua for a week but relocated this morning to San Juan del Sur minus my travelling companions.
[2018-04-08, 11:51:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh ok forgot
[2018-04-08, 11:51:37 AM] Jamie: Such a relieve to be fully in charge of my own path again, lol.
[2018-04-08, 11:51:54 AM] Jamie: And there are plenty of hot girls in SJDS
[2018-04-08, 11:53:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha I remember
[2018-04-08, 11:58:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Just chatting with neighbors
[2018-04-08, 11:58:49 AM] Rob Feeny: I can call in a bit
[2018-04-08, 11:59:11 AM] Jamie: Cool. Sure I’m just reading my book and people watching

[2018-04-08, 12:02:10 PM] Jamie: Is that Kelly’s place?
[2018-04-08, 12:02:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Neighbor Jay
[2018-04-08, 12:02:23 PM] Jamie: Ahhh
[2018-04-08, 12:07:11 PM] Jamie: Water looks pretty stagnant, lol. Would you swim in it?
[2018-04-08, 12:08:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, it's the ocean...
[2018-04-08, 12:08:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Not stagnant, just lots of flotsam
[2018-04-08, 12:09:01 PM] Jamie: Any waves or completely sheltered?
‎[2018-04-08, 12:09:27 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎video omitted
[2018-04-08, 12:09:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Sheltered there
[2018-04-08, 12:09:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Waves on the other side
[2018-04-08, 12:09:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Some might lap around
[2018-04-08, 12:12:12 PM] Jamie: From what I got from the video, more than half the shore front is the covenant?
[2018-04-08, 12:12:28 PM] Rob Feeny: No, it's more like 1/3 or less
[2018-04-08, 12:12:38 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2018-04-08, 12:12:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Sounds like the dock in town is a bit of a challenge in the summer but they make it work
[2018-04-08, 12:12:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Winter is great
[2018-04-08, 12:13:11 PM] Rob Feeny: You can be wait listed for a private dock spot
[2018-04-08, 12:13:30 PM] Jamie: Ok. So the ocean front part is about 120m long?
[2018-04-08, 12:14:40 PM] Rob Feeny: It's hard to tell, it might be in the Trello info
[2018-04-08, 12:15:10 PM] Jamie: Cool I can check it out.

[2018-04-08, 12:17:59 PM] Jamie: Ok great. Gut feeling?
[2018-04-08, 12:18:56 PM] Jamie: How many trees would we have to take out to drag a tiny house far enough to be behind the legal tidal mark?
[2018-04-08, 12:19:38 PM] Rob Feeny: That's a hard one, I haven't done a full loop of the property, it would be a challenge for me shore. Getting a tiny to a spot close to the shore would be a real challenge
[2018-04-08, 12:20:30 PM] Jamie: Yeah and very expensive to clear an area

[2018-04-08, 2:51:27 PM] Jamie: Well it’s much more appealing at low tide with some beach

[2018-04-08, 3:05:30 PM] Jamie: Internet is slow, just downloading
[2018-04-08, 3:05:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Np
[2018-04-08, 3:06:59 PM] Rob Feeny: BTW Kelly says that at the lowest tide, the entire dock is on the bottom and the water's edge is about 12ft out from the end of ig
[2018-04-08, 3:07:00 PM] Rob Feeny: It
[2018-04-08, 3:08:08 PM] Jamie: Wow huge tidal movement.
[2018-04-08, 3:08:23 PM] Rob Feeny: 9 to 12ft I think he said?
[2018-04-08, 3:09:18 PM] Jamie: Yeah I think I saw that in some fisheries spreadsheets online.
[2018-04-08, 3:15:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man that delay makes it hard!
[2018-04-08, 3:16:40 PM] Jamie: Haha yeah not bad considering it was free, you are on an island and I am on Nicaragua.
[2018-04-08, 3:30:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha true
[2018-04-08, 7:40:43 PM] Jamie: Hey I wonder if the ‘natural boundary of the Uclulet inlet’ is measured at high tide or low tide?
[2018-04-08, 7:42:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Kelly says high tide
[2018-04-08, 7:43:10 PM] Jamie: Ok. The way I read the legal doc, it is both 30m and 4m
[2018-04-08, 7:44:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Me too.
[2018-04-08, 7:45:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I think we should collate all the different references and their sources then call the realtor
[2018-04-08, 7:46:21 PM] Jamie: Makes sense. Also, there is no distinction on the width of the raised wood pedestrian walk way, lol. Nor does it have to be straight.
[2018-04-08, 7:46:49 PM] Jamie: 8 feet wide and an s pattern taking up 20 feet
[2018-04-08, 7:48:34 PM] Jamie: ￼
[2018-04-08, 7:49:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Not sure what that is.?
[2018-04-08, 7:49:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha exactly what I was thinking.. The boardwalk could hit the exact spots where you want to take out trees...
[2018-04-08, 7:49:39 PM] Rob Feeny: The neighbors in lot 10 seem amazing

[2018-04-08, 7:51:01 PM] Jamie: Lol. I got skills. Been practicing for 6 months. My new career
[2018-04-08, 7:59:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Driving again. On the ferry I'll update the Trello

[2018-04-09, 12:11:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Trello is updated, gallery shared, spreadsheet of rough costs/times shared
[2018-04-09, 12:12:20 PM] Rob Feeny: I am going to sit down with Daniel, my friend who has build a cabin on Gambier Island and is a tiny structure/cabin designer to talk shop
[2018-04-09, 12:13:36 PM] Jamie: Awesome. I think that is the next step. We need to estimate clearing costs, well running costs, septic field costs/feasibility and structure building costs.
[2018-04-09, 12:13:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Check the spreadsheet
[2018-04-09, 12:14:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Got rough numbers for each, will refine those
[2018-04-09, 12:19:42 PM] Jamie: Checked it out. It’s a tough decision. I’m not ready to buy into something that will take up all my time and money right now.
[2018-04-09, 12:20:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, Daniel is in there right now actually giving me more info
[2018-04-09, 12:20:39 PM] Jamie: Mentally I saw the purchase as one thing and the build (offsite) as something I could monitor and help with without having to travel to the island.
[2018-04-09, 12:21:03 PM] Jamie: Almost 300k is sort of crazy
[2018-04-09, 12:22:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I get it. It's an amazing property but it would take over your life for a long time
[2018-04-09, 12:23:11 PM] Jamie: Yes. And I have only gotten my freedom back in the last 6 months. That would be a huge job with no real income/profit potential for years.
[2018-04-09, 12:23:16 PM] Rob Feeny: But that's why we do research, right? It's sad that there isn't really a way to get something prefab on.. Well, it's possible but very expensive, would take large changes to the road of bringing a barge in from somewhere far and a LOT of winching or giant barge-mounted crane
[2018-04-09, 12:24:17 PM] Jamie: Oh I like the idea of building onsite too.  It can be simpler I think.
[2018-04-09, 12:24:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup but it's a multi-year project that could get discouraging. I get it.
[2018-04-09, 12:25:32 PM] Rob Feeny: The couple next door have each other, farming history and the help of her parents. plus they want the homesteading life, not the oceanfront life
[2018-04-09, 12:25:49 PM] Jamie: But with the cash I have the only way to do this is to borrow and then have debt again or dedicate the next 4 years of working a job to self finance.
[2018-04-09, 12:26:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, kinda sucks
[2018-04-09, 12:26:36 PM] Rob Feeny: But hey, now the research is done, you know and won't go "What if?"
[2018-04-09, 12:27:13 PM] Jamie: Yup totally. Let’s finish our due diligence and then tackle the final number and timeline. Make sense?
[2018-04-09, 12:27:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, I'll bug Daniel but it'll probably be Thursday when we meet up for beers
[2018-04-09, 12:27:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Feel free to play with that spreadsheet and the Trello board
[2018-04-09, 12:28:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I need to get to work and install some shit!
[2018-04-09, 12:28:17 PM] Jamie: Ok will do. Haha yeah get to work
[2018-04-09, 12:29:52 PM] Jamie: Also I wonder if we would ever earn our money back for the site prep costs? Maybe I am bug Marla for some comparable with septic field, site cleared etc
[2018-04-09, 12:30:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Well as soon as there is running water and a septic field it is possible to get a mortgage which greatly improves the value
[2018-04-09, 12:31:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Like as soon as it is a home not a bare lot
[2018-04-09, 12:31:27 PM] Jamie: No I think you need both services. Power as well. I tried with dads cabin. He had the same problem
[2018-04-09, 12:31:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok. And getting hydro there starts at 100k
[2018-04-09, 12:35:49 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah. But once the island is more populated, it’s an option. Also possible I can do the work on the island side.
[2018-04-09, 12:36:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. Lame thought, the rules might need to change as solar and off grid becomes a more realistic option
[2018-04-09, 12:39:18 PM] Jamie: Would be even cooler if we did a micro generation protect on the island. Everybody shares all available resources up to a max. Must contribute to use.
[2018-04-09, 12:40:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I even mentioned that to the guys there. One side gets wind, one gets sun. A microgrid would allow trading/selling of electricity between neighbors, they already have apps for it
[2018-04-09, 12:51:19 PM] Jamie: That would be very cool.
[2018-04-09, 12:52:05 PM] Jamie: Income potential? Lol. Set up the grid using someone else’s financing and sell to the owners of the island.
[2018-04-16, 8:40:57 AM] Rob Feeny: So we should have a conversation seen about Kvarno. If it's a no-go I want to let the neighbors know and thank them for their help
[2018-04-16, 12:06:07 PM] Jamie: Ok let me know when you are available. I’m definitely not ready to make a decision. If I had to today, I would go with no.
[2018-04-16, 12:09:22 PM] Jamie: It’s a long term gamble with nothing but costs up front and no obvious immediate value or guaranteed financial payoff in the long run. If a good equity investment, it’s 10-15 years out, once power is on the island.
[2018-04-16, 9:09:05 PM] Rob Feeny: You free?
[2018-04-16, 9:09:17 PM] Jamie: Yup

[2018-04-17, 10:38:16 AM] Jamie: Looks beautiful
[2018-04-21, 1:51:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok new tab in Kvarno spreadsheet, spent $374.50 in total
[2018-04-21, 1:53:58 PM] Jamie: Was the deal I pay for all of it?
[2018-04-21, 2:03:10 PM] Rob Feeny: It was, if we didn't buy, and I'd donate the time, but I'm fine splitting it
[2018-04-22, 6:33:56 PM] Rob Feeny: So now you understand the Insanity of Semana Santa
[2018-04-22, 6:34:54 PM] Jamie: Haha yeah. We tried to leave and couldn’t find lodging anywhere else in Nicaragua
[2018-04-22, 6:35:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. We didn't have accommodations one night for Semana Santa so we had to stay up the entire night and sleep on the bus
[2018-04-22, 6:36:06 PM] Rob Feeny: There was nothing for less than $400us a night
[2018-04-22, 6:40:44 PM] Jamie: It’s crazy. Rational people just lost their mind for 4 days. They bused in locals partying in San Juan Del Sur. Total retards, screaming and yelling like children.
[2018-04-22, 6:42:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. They all regress to being toddlers or something
[2018-04-25, 7:29:34 PM] Jamie: My new house!


Here's your PNW dream
https://www.reddit.com/r/liveaboard/comments/8evg15/heres_your_pnw_dream/?st=JGFSJ80C&sh=1a5c7827
[2018-04-25, 7:35:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow
[2018-04-25, 7:35:17 PM] Rob Feeny: She's a beast..n
[2018-04-25, 7:37:12 PM] Jamie: Haha it would be awesome. Just build the tiny house on that
[2018-04-25, 7:37:39 PM] Rob Feeny: lol indeed, but it looks like a bit of a heavy pig!
[2018-04-25, 7:38:02 PM] Rob Feeny: But I bet you could kit it out nicely
[2018-04-25, 7:38:38 PM] Jamie: Yeah it would probably be marina bound for life
[2018-04-25, 7:38:52 PM] Jamie: Oh shoot I haven’t transferred that cash
[2018-04-25, 7:39:42 PM] Rob Feeny: No stress
[2018-04-25, 8:03:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow kados finally has their liquor license back
[2018-04-25, 8:03:52 PM] Jamie: Seriously? Just now? Odd that’s like 7-8 months seems random
[2018-04-25, 8:06:31 PM] Rob Feeny: , someone said they were fighting with the city and it was a long ugly process
[2018-04-25, 11:34:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha just saw that crappy voice to text transcription. But you figured it out
[2018-04-29, 9:35:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Just doing all my financials today, can you send that transfer?
[2018-04-29, 9:55:17 AM] Jamie: Yeah will do. Need to dig out my bank card as my fingerprint id cleared somehow
[2018-04-29, 9:55:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. How's surfing life?
[2018-04-29, 9:56:30 AM] Jamie: It’s good. The waves here are pretty big and I am struggling. Falling lots, body is sore. Having trouble motivating myself to go out and get my ass kicked everyday
[2018-04-29, 9:56:49 AM] Jamie: How’s van?
[2018-04-29, 9:56:55 AM] Jamie: Hear it’s been nice
[2018-04-29, 9:57:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah but back to rain for the weekend
[2018-04-29, 9:57:27 AM] Rob Feeny: And I suppose you're getting strong and more comfortable navigating those big waves tho
[2018-04-29, 9:57:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Now when you go back to smaller waves you'll eat them alive
[2018-04-29, 9:57:51 AM] Jamie: Oh yeah. And my duck dive is really improving.
[2018-04-29, 9:58:00 AM] Jamie: Haha I sure hope so
[2018-04-29, 9:58:12 AM] Jamie: But I think I will stay here for a few months.
[2018-04-29, 9:58:31 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha from the looks of that hostel I could too!
[2018-04-29, 9:59:18 AM] Jamie: Yeah it’s pretty good for bringing people in. And they have a buffet breakfast, by weight, that ends up being pretty cheap
[2018-04-29, 9:59:23 AM] Jamie: About $5
[2018-04-29, 9:59:49 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice. What's the city again?
[2018-04-29, 9:59:50 AM] Jamie: Which is unusual here, it’s surprisingly expensive
[2018-04-29, 9:59:59 AM] Jamie: Santa Teresa, CR
[2018-04-29, 10:01:23 AM] Jamie: See me on Google Maps!
https://maps.app.goo.gl/kgsojSQd1sNVM1HE3
[2018-04-29, 10:01:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha I was just googling it
[2018-04-29, 10:01:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Lots of expats? And backpackers?
[2018-04-29, 10:02:48 AM] Jamie: Yes to both. A second generation of expats even. People have stayed and had kids that have grown up
[2018-04-29, 10:03:23 AM] Jamie: And tons of backpackers through. 5 new a day on average, weekends more
[2018-04-29, 10:03:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow. Lots of English? I've heard that about Costa Rica
[2018-04-29, 10:03:38 AM] Rob Feeny: Any luck with the ladies?
[2018-04-29, 10:04:07 AM] Jamie: ALL English. Only use Spanish to talk to the taxi guys, my side of the convo with servers
[2018-04-29, 10:04:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Weird
[2018-04-29, 10:05:44 AM] Jamie: Not really. Lots of hanging out, spending a lot of time with the 2 20 year old Swiss girls in my room but the hot one has a boyfriend that cheated on here a few month ago so it’s a red zone, lol
[2018-04-29, 10:06:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha dangerous. But technically she's got a freebie ;)
[2018-04-29, 10:06:50 AM] Jamie: Nah too complicated. She would cry afterwards I think
[2018-04-29, 10:07:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh man
[2018-04-29, 10:08:21 AM] Jamie: But we have a blast. I have given 4 beautiful girls surf lessons which is a great way to spend a day
[2018-04-29, 10:09:46 AM] Jamie: Do anything this weekend?
[2018-04-29, 10:10:33 AM] Rob Feeny: Sounds amazing
[2018-04-29, 10:11:27 AM] Rob Feeny: We were supposed to go kayaking yesterday but it was too rainy. Made breakfast for Am and Elex, worked on my place and then went on a date. Just doing Physio and working out before joining friends for brunch
[2018-04-29, 10:11:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Being injured is killing me, no outdoor activities
[2018-04-29, 10:11:56 AM] Jamie: What did you do?
[2018-04-29, 10:12:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Crashed my motorcycle, damaged my MCL
[2018-04-29, 10:12:36 AM] Jamie: This was a while ago?
[2018-04-29, 10:13:09 AM] Rob Feeny: 3 weeks?
[2018-04-29, 10:13:19 AM] Jamie: Oh shit. The new bike?
[2018-04-29, 10:13:33 AM] Jamie: What happened?
[2018-04-29, 10:13:53 AM] Rob Feeny: New bike has a front disc brake, brakes way harder than the old one
[2018-04-29, 10:14:12 AM] Rob Feeny: I tried to brake like I do on the old one, locked up the front wheel in a corner.
[2018-04-29, 10:14:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Wasn't going super fast, was wearing lots of gear, so I was fine except for my knee
[2018-04-29, 10:14:58 AM] Rob Feeny: 3rd injury to that leg in 2 yrs
[2018-04-29, 10:15:29 AM] Jamie: Super lame man, gonna feel that when you are old and the wether turns, haha
[2018-04-29, 10:15:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha do you?
[2018-04-29, 10:15:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Seeing as you're old
[2018-04-29, 10:16:15 AM] Jamie: Funny, in Nicaragua the water was so cold that I could feel each and every one of my old injuries. Elbow, wrist, leg, even the toe I stubbed a couple years back
[2018-04-29, 10:16:33 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow
[2018-04-29, 10:16:45 AM] Rob Feeny: I remember that, San Juan del Sur was too cold for swimming
[2018-04-29, 10:17:07 AM] Jamie: Yeah Playa Madera was shockingly cold.
[2018-04-29, 10:17:23 AM] Jamie: Surfing definitely pushes my body to its limits.
[2018-04-29, 10:17:37 AM] Rob Feeny: But keeps you young?
[2018-04-29, 10:18:09 AM] Jamie: Yeah everyone is suprised I’m 40 that’s for sure
[2018-04-29, 10:18:47 AM] Rob Feeny: The Feeny genes
[2018-04-29, 10:19:26 AM] Rob Feeny: A blessing and a curse
[2018-04-29, 10:19:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Did I tell you I was sleeping with Alona?
[2018-04-29, 10:19:44 AM] Jamie: Yeah I guess right. I have actually had to start using moisturizer every day because the salt water and sun everyday drys out my skin and gives me bad acne
[2018-04-29, 10:19:58 AM] Jamie: Who’s Alona?
[2018-04-29, 10:20:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha I bet, weathers you
[2018-04-29, 10:20:06 AM] Rob Feeny: From Starbucks
[2018-04-29, 10:20:19 AM] Jamie: Oh no how’s that going?
[2018-04-29, 10:20:28 AM] Rob Feeny: 20yr old Russian. Made me feel young and old
[2018-04-29, 10:20:46 AM] Jamie: I remember her. Big boobs, a flirt
[2018-04-29, 10:20:51 AM] Rob Feeny: It was fun for a bit but then she got weird. She is very 20.
[2018-04-29, 10:21:31 AM] Jamie: Yeah I hear that. I have almost tolerance for that sort of stuff anymore. Even the sex is not worth it for me
[2018-04-29, 10:22:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah I'd love to find someone older who is comfortable with themselves and sex. No drama
[2018-04-29, 10:22:34 AM] Rob Feeny: But looking young can be a hindrance
[2018-04-29, 10:23:13 AM] Jamie: Yeah me too. I did meet a great girl from Norway that was really into me but so painfully shy
[2018-04-29, 10:23:25 AM] Rob Feeny: How old?
[2018-04-29, 10:23:38 AM] Jamie: 33, beautiful blue eyes and very smart, successful
[2018-04-29, 10:23:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow
[2018-04-29, 10:23:56 AM] Rob Feeny: But too tough to interact with?
‎[2018-04-29, 10:25:23 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2018-04-29, 10:26:01 AM] Rob Feeny: Heck yah
[2018-04-29, 10:26:02 AM] Jamie: Well after a while I drew her out but still she was incredibly reserved.
[2018-04-29, 10:26:18 AM] Rob Feeny: That's part of their culture too
[2018-04-29, 10:26:32 AM] Jamie: I think part of it was I was surrounded by young beautiful girls and also was interested in another girl at the time
‎[2018-04-29, 10:27:31 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted

[2018-04-29, 10:27:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Jesus
[2018-04-29, 10:27:53 AM] Jamie: and she was just so freaking hot
[2018-04-29, 10:28:25 AM] Jamie: Yeah... she was at the tail end of a relationship so I didn’t push hard but ... damn
[2018-04-29, 10:29:06 AM] Rob Feeny: From where?
[2018-04-29, 10:29:11 AM] Jamie: Haha that’s part of a video she asked me to record for her so she could paint a picture for a friends birthday of a girl duck diving.
[2018-04-29, 10:29:16 AM] Jamie: Colorado
[2018-04-29, 10:29:26 AM] Jamie: 24 and suuuuuuuuper flaky
[2018-04-29, 10:29:47 AM] Rob Feeny: When you're that hot you can get away with it (for now)
[2018-04-29, 10:30:42 AM] Jamie: Yup. She just left Montañita yesterday to move to North Carolina to be with a guy she met a month ago, they are going to buy a van and drive from Chile to Mexico in September.
[2018-04-29, 10:31:02 AM] Jamie: Like a leaf in the wind
[2018-04-29, 10:31:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow. Does she have money?
[2018-04-29, 10:31:06 AM] Jamie: Nope
[2018-04-29, 10:31:28 AM] Jamie: That’s why she went there, to work and make more money for the trip
[2018-04-29, 10:32:01 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhhh ok. But still, it'd be an amazing adventure
[2018-04-29, 10:32:24 AM] Jamie: Her Instagram is incredibly interesting though. She plays guitar, Surf’s, highlines, rock climbs, snowboard, fire dancer etc
[2018-04-29, 10:32:46 AM] Jamie: Maybe I can track her down at 27 year of age 😜
‎[2018-04-29, 10:33:41 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2018-04-29, 10:33:58 AM] Jamie: These are my Swiss roomies
[2018-04-29, 10:34:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice, I'm more admiring the plants in the background hahw
[2018-04-29, 10:34:58 AM] Rob Feeny: I tried to grow those at my place in ESA
[2018-04-29, 10:35:27 AM] Jamie: Yeah it’s the patio of this awesome cafe here. Beautiful staff too
[2018-04-29, 10:36:08 AM] Rob Feeny: But the one on the left is damn cute
[2018-04-29, 10:36:50 AM] Jamie: Yeah and she has an absolutely rocking’ body. 😋
[2018-04-29, 10:37:01 AM] Rob Feeny: But 20.. yeeeps
[2018-04-30, 12:52:05 PM] Jamie: Get the email?
[2018-04-30, 12:52:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup just deposited it, thanks man
[2018-04-30, 1:30:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha just drove to Maple Ridge for a job and they cancelled it
[2018-04-30, 1:40:56 PM] Jamie: Lame. Well... day off!!
[2018-04-30, 1:41:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah until 6 p.m. I've got a night job I can bil time-and-a-half for
[2018-04-30, 1:41:48 PM] Rob Feeny: It's not all bad I've got a friend in Maple Ridge I can go to lunch with
[2018-05-01, 11:48:34 PM] Rob Feeny: https://globalnews.ca/news/4178438/brazilian-surfer-80-foot-wave-world-record/
[2018-05-01, 11:48:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Life goals
[2018-05-06, 5:20:44 PM] Jamie: Hey any chance I can get you to dig something out of my Jamie Feeny files?
[2018-05-06, 5:21:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure, the ones in my cold storage?
[2018-05-06, 5:21:46 PM] Jamie: Yup. I need the card number of my National Bank mortgage account.
[2018-05-06, 5:22:02 PM] Jamie: The card should be in the mortgage file
[2018-05-06, 5:22:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Know which color box?
[2018-05-06, 5:23:07 PM] Jamie: I think there is only one labelled Jamie Feeny current but no I’m not sure. Cardboard file box though, white I think
[2018-05-06, 5:24:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Working on it
[2018-05-06, 5:24:52 PM] Jamie: Thx man!
[2018-05-06, 5:25:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap does your writing look like mine
[2018-05-06, 5:25:41 PM] Jamie: Could be yours, you organized it, lol
[2018-05-06, 5:26:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha oh yah
‎[2018-05-06, 5:26:27 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-05-06, 5:26:48 PM] Jamie: Fantastic. Appreciate it. Got my computer back up and running
[2018-05-06, 5:27:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh beauty
[2018-05-09, 12:57:33 PM] Jamie: Hey can I host a website under the Feeny.ca domain? Something like www.jamie/Feeny.ca
[2018-05-09, 12:57:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. It would be jamie.feeny.ca
[2018-05-09, 12:58:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Or you could do feeny.ca/Jamie
[2018-05-09, 12:58:30 PM] Jamie: Jamie.feeny.ca would be awesome.
[2018-05-09, 12:58:50 PM] Jamie: Just learning a little about creating websites so need a place to practise.
[2018-05-09, 12:59:43 PM] Jamie: Do I need your wordpress password to do it? Or can I be added as admin?
[2018-05-09, 1:00:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm good question
[2018-05-09, 1:00:27 PM] Rob Feeny: I have a hosting package that has tons of room to spare
[2018-05-09, 1:00:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Just need to sort out how you would access it. There's two part. There's a login for the hosting account then a login for the wordpress site
[2018-05-09, 1:01:17 PM] Rob Feeny: You'd probably log in as me for the hosting account and use that account to create your own wordpress instance that you would log into as yourself
[2018-05-09, 1:01:59 PM] Jamie: What’s the hosting company?
[2018-05-09, 1:02:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Hostgator
[2018-05-09, 1:03:14 PM] Jamie: Ok I will read up on that today
[2018-05-09, 1:06:46 PM] Jamie: Looks like I would install another instance of Wordpress on the sub domain after I create it.
[2018-05-09, 1:11:15 PM] Jamie: Doesn’t have to be right now but if I could have the hosting user and password, I could set this up myself.
[2018-05-09, 1:12:32 PM] Rob Feeny: working on that
[2018-05-09, 1:12:54 PM] Jamie: Thanks man. What are you doing? Starbucks?
[2018-05-09, 1:13:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah doing some tech support for a client of Morgan's
[2018-05-09, 1:13:13 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2018-05-09, 1:13:21 PM] Rob Feeny: It's killing me. Trying to migrate her Office 365 stuff to Gmail
[2018-05-09, 1:13:32 PM] Jamie: Uggggg
[2018-05-09, 1:13:49 PM] Jamie: Can’t you DA that shit to India?
[2018-05-09, 1:14:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha if she wasn't such a shitshow, yes
[2018-05-09, 1:14:24 PM] Rob Feeny: But it also involves the passwords and access to her personal email accounts so...
[2018-05-09, 1:14:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Every thing I am reading says that email forwarding should be working but it's not
[2018-05-09, 1:14:46 PM] Rob Feeny: I've been on it for hours
[2018-05-09, 1:16:06 PM] Jamie: Yeah if I remember correctly there was a real delay when I was trying to forward my hotmail to gmail. For it to start. Like the next day long. But it was years ago
[2018-05-09, 1:16:51 PM] Jamie: So I might be coming back to Vancouver for the summer. If I get into this course —> https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/ios-bootcamp
[2018-05-09, 1:16:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah this just fails and returns an error. I hate microsoft products
[2018-05-09, 1:17:44 PM] Rob Feeny: https://gator3076.hostgator.com:2083
[2018-05-09, 1:17:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Pass is "jamiereallysucks!"
[2018-05-09, 1:17:56 PM] Rob Feeny: they needed 25 characters
[2018-05-09, 1:20:02 PM] Jamie: Haha very funny
[2018-05-09, 1:20:28 PM] Jamie: So I might be coming back to Vancouver for the summer. If I get into this course —> https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/ios-bootcamp
[2018-05-09, 1:21:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Very cool. Can your old brain handle that?
[2018-05-09, 1:21:15 PM] Rob Feeny: I've got a couch if you need one
[2018-05-09, 1:21:54 PM] Jamie: I think it can. You have to do 80hrs or training modules BEFORE the course starts. They want a high success rate
[2018-05-09, 1:22:07 PM] Jamie: $10k for the 10 weeks
[2018-05-09, 1:22:44 PM] Jamie: And I’m not sure what to do about short term housing but definitely could use your couch for a few days when I first get back. Thanks
[2018-05-09, 1:24:07 PM] Jamie: What’s the user name for the hosting account?
[2018-05-09, 1:26:46 PM] Rob Feeny: oops rfeeny
[2018-05-09, 1:26:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Tent in the yard?
[2018-05-09, 1:34:59 PM] Jamie: Haha maybe sleeping in my truck. Course is gastown so Fairmont would be best. Gas in my truck will be a killer with no income
[2018-05-09, 1:35:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Morgan's Georgia Street property is fairly close to there
[2018-05-09, 1:35:30 PM] Rob Feeny: and gas is @ 1.61 right now
[2018-05-09, 1:36:19 PM] Jamie: Ok I will have to look into it. The basement at fairmont would at least be removed from the people upstairs, just morgan and crew there all the time which would be fine.
[2018-05-09, 1:36:50 PM] Jamie: Your linked in page looks good, btw. Noticed the redirect and tested it
[2018-05-09, 1:37:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks, just touched it up for the job I applied for
[2018-05-09, 1:45:03 PM] Jamie: Ok got the si domain set up, installed an instance of Wordpress and now I will built my first website!
[2018-05-09, 1:45:09 PM] Jamie: sub*
[2018-05-09, 1:45:16 PM] Rob Feeny: hahah good luck!
[2018-05-09, 2:08:18 PM] Jamie: Yeah I will need it. But I uploaded a picture so far, lol
[2018-05-11, 9:44:39 AM] Jamie: Hey how did your face heal up?
‎[2018-05-11, 9:50:12 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-05-11, 9:50:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmm looks better in pics
[2018-05-11, 9:50:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Still a fairly visible mark
[2018-05-11, 9:51:35 AM] Jamie: Yeah but no obvious scarring. Smooth so it should heal as the skin does. Get it sunburnt and it will help the transition of the current skin, haha
[2018-05-11, 9:54:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep. I figure another 6months and it'll be gone
[2018-05-11, 9:56:06 AM] Jamie: I have heard of people in wheelchairs after that sort of accident.
[2018-05-11, 9:56:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I will count myself lucky. And my Whiplash is being treated as part of my ICBC claim because I said it came from my motorcycle accident
[2018-05-11, 9:57:50 AM] Jamie: Always the angle with the insurance, lol
[2018-05-11, 9:58:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Well I was paying $85 a session to deal with that in my knee issue already now it's just all three things at once for $35
[2018-05-11, 10:02:33 AM] Rob Feeny: How goes surfing Life?
[2018-05-11, 10:24:46 AM] Jamie: It’s good. This morning was really awesome. Been struggling so I rented a bigger board last week and it was ok. But today I got on my small board and it felt solid and great
[2018-05-11, 10:25:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice. How many hours a week do you log on the water?
[2018-05-11, 10:39:57 AM] Jamie: Not too many maybe 6-10 these days. Generally 1-1.5 hrs each day. The waves have not been awesome
[2018-05-11, 10:40:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm damn. So what do you do with your time?
[2018-05-11, 10:41:05 AM] Jamie: Got my computer back so I have been learning python. Reading, swimming, eating, drinking coffee. Watching the sunset and all the surfers
[2018-05-11, 10:41:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Not such a bad life. Wish I could just learn full time
[2018-05-11, 10:43:04 AM] Jamie: Yeah the problem with having full time access to surfing is I take for granted I can just go tomorrow.
[2018-05-11, 10:43:45 AM] Jamie: I don’t feel like I am putting in the same amount of effort and my learning has slowed. But what can ya do?
[2018-05-11, 10:44:35 AM] Rob Feeny: Take a trip into the interior for a while? Focus on learning and see if a week away renews interest?
[2018-05-11, 10:44:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Or find a cute girl to teach ;)
[2018-05-11, 10:45:14 AM] Jamie: I have been teaching some girls for sure. Passes the time and the view from the back is nothing short of phenomenal
[2018-05-11, 10:45:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha lecherous old man
[2018-05-11, 10:46:05 AM] Rob Feeny: And have you been enjoying any of them in bed?
[2018-05-11, 10:49:37 AM] Jamie: No. It’s definitely tough living in the dorms and if you don’t party with them, you don’t sleep with them.
[2018-05-11, 10:50:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhhh and they change too quickly to build anything I bet
[2018-05-11, 10:50:32 AM] Jamie: Yup. Average is 3 days.
[2018-05-11, 10:51:15 AM] Jamie: There was that Swiss girl that if she didn’t have a boyfriend, definitely would have happened. 20 lol
[2018-05-11, 10:51:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Man. Dangerous. Makes you unsatisfied with older women...
[2018-05-11, 10:53:18 AM] Jamie: Yes and no. I actually appreciate older women because they have more depth. These girls are a dime a dozen here hard to tell apart. Suntan, party, sleep, repeat
[2018-05-11, 10:53:47 AM] Jamie: Every once in a while I meet an older girl that isn’t into the party scene and some great convos happen
[2018-05-11, 10:56:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice. And if they're traveling solo they're probably interesting people
[2018-05-11, 11:07:26 AM] Jamie: Yeah
[2018-05-11, 11:10:30 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm not sure why Marla keeps CCing me on your properties you're looking at in Nanaimo
[2018-05-11, 11:11:35 AM] Jamie: Yeah me neither
[2018-05-11, 5:31:57 PM] Jamie: So I lost me website, lol. Installed wordless and started creating a site but it wasn’t at the proper jamie.feeny.ca but jamie.feeny.ca/host/jamie. So it found in the wordprss setting where you can point to it the right one but now it’s lost, lol
[2018-05-11, 5:40:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha crap! How much work did you lose?
[2018-05-11, 5:43:57 PM] Jamie: Not much at all 1 post and a background photo. I can find all the Wordpress files I just can’t get the website to come back live. I think I have to delete and reinstall
[2018-05-11, 5:44:36 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't know enough to be able to help you!
[2018-05-11, 5:45:08 PM] Jamie: It’s all good. This might be my new career, haha. Guess I should learn
[2018-05-11, 5:45:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Then master the art of subbing out the grunt work to others
[2018-05-11, 5:46:05 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a tricky field because you compete with the developing world
[2018-05-11, 5:47:07 PM] Jamie: Yeah web dev is not really what I want to do but you have to understand the structure to interface with it using apps and APIs
[2018-05-11, 5:48:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Definitely. And the best way to learn...
[2018-05-11, 7:51:42 PM] Jamie: Got my website back!!!!
[2018-05-11, 8:10:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha sweet
[2018-05-11, 8:10:13 PM] Rob Feeny: How's it looking?
[2018-05-11, 8:10:38 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎Missed video call
[2018-05-11, 8:10:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Oops
[2018-05-11, 8:10:49 PM] Jamie: 1 post. Haha it’s live at www.jamie.feeny.ca
[2018-05-11, 9:03:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha nice, looks good so far
[2018-05-14, 3:22:29 PM] Jamie: So what’s the cheapest cell phone contract I can get?
[2018-05-14, 3:33:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Not actually sure? Probably something like Dad's Speakout wireless one, from 7-11.
[2018-05-14, 3:34:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Pay as you go
[2018-05-14, 3:34:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Or I could see what it costs to add a line to my account
[2018-05-14, 3:34:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Dad would be a good one to ask about that
[2018-05-14, 3:35:03 PM] Jamie: Appreciate it but I will get my own. Yeah good call, he would love to talk about the deal he negotiated, lol. The small pleasures he enjoys
[2018-05-14, 4:59:52 PM] Jamie: Hey I might need you to try to find my 2016 personal tax assessment in my files if possible. Do you have a chance over the next day or two?
[2018-05-14, 5:00:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I probably could tonight
[2018-05-14, 5:06:43 PM] Jamie: Thanks dude
[2018-05-15, 12:40:28 AM] Rob Feeny: Thanks for hiding this in the back of the 2010 file. Ass.

[2018-05-15, 12:42:55 AM] Rob Feeny: You're up late
[2018-05-15, 12:43:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Did I wake you?
[2018-05-15, 12:43:47 AM] Jamie: Phone under my pillow on vibrate for surfing early. All good
[2018-05-15, 12:44:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Ah shit sorry. Silent mode!
[2018-05-15, 12:44:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Night.
[2018-05-15, 8:43:31 AM] Rob Feeny: My bathroom light and fan are on the same switch. Can I use a dimmer to control them? It was be amazing to be able to turn down the fan
[2018-05-15, 9:03:06 AM] Jamie: No it would wreck a dimmer
[2018-05-15, 9:04:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2018-05-15, 9:04:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Thx
[2018-05-15, 11:25:10 AM] Jamie: Got some plans shaping up for your birthday?
[2018-05-15, 11:31:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep, just working on them now, rather last minute
[2018-05-15, 11:32:07 AM] Rob Feeny: But hey if I get 5 or 6 people out for drinks I'm happy
[2018-05-15, 11:32:49 AM] Jamie: Yeah that should be cool. Got any camping planned for the summer?
[2018-05-15, 10:56:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, just working on some right now for Abbotsford/Hope area
[2018-05-17, 9:48:25 AM] Jamie: This is some crazy shit. 


Alberta passes bill to restrict oil flow to British Columbia, escalating trade war
https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/8k3h8v/alberta_passes_bill_to_restrict_oil_flow_to/?st=JHANGMTG&sh=8274be19
[2018-05-17, 9:50:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Heck yah. It's sad, given what I know of renewables, the demand is going to drop in the next decade and so much money will have been wasted. The end has begun for the oilsands too
[2018-05-17, 9:50:53 AM] Rob Feeny: But hey, they'll drive adoption of electric vehicles and efficient ones. Plus we supply them with a lot of electricity, maybe we can cut it off?
[2018-05-17, 9:51:41 AM] Jamie: Yeah. I think BC is protecting itself which is good, but Alberta has been an economic driver of Canada for years. But this provincial infighting shows a weak Federal government I think
[2018-05-17, 9:56:06 AM] Rob Feeny: I agree. It's crazy that it's come to this
[2018-05-20, 4:59:26 PM] Jamie: Happy birthday fucker
[2018-05-20, 4:59:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks old man
[2018-05-20, 5:00:03 PM] Jamie: What did you end up doing?
[2018-05-20, 5:00:09 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm reading a book at Starbucks on Bernard
[2018-05-20, 5:00:20 PM] Jamie: Oh nice. Went to Kelowna
[2018-05-20, 5:00:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Yesterday we rode bikes and drank then BBQed with a friend
[2018-05-20, 5:00:28 PM] Rob Feeny: *some friends
[2018-05-20, 5:00:30 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2018-05-20, 5:01:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Super lazy today
[2018-05-20, 6:35:17 PM] Jamie: And tomorrow off. 👍
[2018-05-20, 6:35:22 PM] Jamie: Roads were good?
[2018-05-20, 6:36:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yah, great. Tomorrow I'll head back to reality
[2018-05-23, 3:55:28 PM] Jamie: Booked my flights
[2018-05-23, 4:00:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice! Excited?
[2018-05-23, 4:01:17 PM] Jamie: Yeah actually I am. It will be good to be back and see everyone. Excited about the course I am taking too
[2018-05-23, 4:06:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice man
[2018-05-23, 4:28:30 PM] Rob Feeny: When are you back?
[2018-05-23, 4:28:56 PM] Jamie: I land in Kelowna on the 10th of June.
[2018-05-23, 5:38:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, and when's the course start?
[2018-05-23, 5:42:15 PM] Jamie: July 30th. Some time to chill before it starts and complete the prep work
[2018-05-24, 11:15:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Need an airport pickup on the 10th?
[2018-05-24, 11:23:54 AM] Jamie: You going to be in Kelowna? I think Dave can grab me but thanks
[2018-05-24, 11:24:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh shot for some reason I read that as Van
[2018-05-28, 2:15:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Where do you usually find tenants for your condo in Calgary? Just looking at rental prices out there
[2018-05-28, 3:16:06 PM] Jamie: Rentfaster.ca
[2018-05-28, 3:16:18 PM] Jamie: Great site. You thinking of heading back there?
[2018-05-28, 3:22:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Got an interview for an amazing job out there
[2018-05-28, 3:22:28 PM] Jamie: What’s the job?
[2018-05-28, 3:22:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Didn't realize I never mentioned it to you. director of a non-profit program that brings solar lights to rural Latin communities
[2018-05-28, 3:23:27 PM] Jamie: Crazy. Based out of Calgary but lots of travel? Pays ok?
[2018-05-28, 3:24:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, not crazy but decent. Based one block from our old place
[2018-05-28, 3:24:31 PM] Jamie: Great neighbourhood!
[2018-05-28, 3:24:49 PM] Jamie: Rent is cheap in Calgary right now, so much rental stock
[2018-05-28, 3:25:03 PM] Jamie: I’m renting mine for $1400 and I see lots below that
[2018-05-28, 3:25:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah another friend pointed me to rentfaster and wow
[2018-05-28, 3:26:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Phone call in 3 min tho
[2018-05-28, 3:26:42 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll let you know how it goes
[2018-05-28, 3:26:52 PM] Jamie: Good luck man!
[2018-05-28, 3:26:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks
[2018-05-28, 4:32:12 PM] Rob Feeny: That went well 👍🏻
[2018-05-28, 4:32:27 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll find out in the next day or two if I get a second interview
[2018-05-28, 4:35:52 PM] Jamie: That’s sweet man. How do you feel about moving back there?
[2018-05-28, 4:36:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm not keen on that part, but it's a great opportunity
[2018-05-28, 4:37:09 PM] Rob Feeny: And I think a change would be good, I'm pretty unfocused here
[2018-06-04, 7:52:19 PM] Jamie: Hey any word on that job?
[2018-06-04, 7:52:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, didn't get it
[2018-06-04, 7:52:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry forgot to tell you
[2018-06-04, 7:52:42 PM] Jamie: Well at least they got back to you fast
[2018-06-04, 7:52:59 PM] Rob Feeny: They wanted people more experienced in non-profits I think
[2018-06-04, 9:08:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I wonder if Dave is drunk Instagramming? He just likes my one photo with my bleeding forehead
[2018-06-04, 9:08:50 PM] Rob Feeny: *liked
[2018-06-04, 9:09:44 PM] Jamie: Yeah he has posted some super weird comments. He doesn’t really understand it. He sometimes answers other people’s comments as if I sent them to him, lol
[2018-06-04, 9:10:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm well that was weird, but hey he's easy to block
[2018-06-18, 2:01:56 PM] Rob Feeny: So how's your website tinkering going?
[2018-06-18, 2:02:29 PM] Jamie: Barely touched it actually. Mostly working on the prep work for my course. How’s van?
[2018-06-18, 2:02:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Hot. Just was playing around on my site (that I largely neglect) and thought of it
[2018-06-18, 2:03:01 PM] Rob Feeny: when's the course start>
[2018-06-18, 2:03:43 PM] Jamie: July 30th. But 80 hrs of prep work to be done before. I’m about half way done.
[2018-06-18, 2:03:49 PM] Jamie: No work today?
[2018-06-18, 2:05:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Yikes
[2018-06-18, 2:05:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm at Starbucks working
[2018-06-18, 2:05:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Just had to finish up some site stuff
[2018-06-18, 2:05:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Playing arounf with referral links
[2018-06-18, 2:06:22 PM] Jamie: Yeah I’m curious about that too. Be interesting to see if money could be made
[2018-06-18, 2:06:31 PM] Jamie: Not working on Supervans?
[2018-06-18, 2:06:46 PM] Rob Feeny: No we both had other things, bumped it to tursday
[2018-06-18, 2:06:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Thursday
[2018-06-18, 2:07:39 PM] Jamie: Ahhh. A day to putter.
[2018-06-18, 2:08:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. Very busy weekend, a slow day is good. Got a ton to get done this week
[2018-06-18, 2:08:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Got your truck up and running et al?
[2018-06-18, 2:10:04 PM] Jamie: Yup truck is up and running. And insured. Big paint chip on the bumper maybe from one of Dave’s guys but other than that, all good
[2018-06-18, 2:10:25 PM] Jamie: Surfboard, one the other hand got smashed up pretty good by the airline. 😬
[2018-06-18, 2:10:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. Not cool. And got a place in van lined up?
[2018-06-18, 2:10:34 PM] Jamie: Totally expected it but still sucks
[2018-06-18, 2:11:01 PM] Jamie: Yeah I think I will stay in Matt and Sally’s basement suite for 3 months.
[2018-06-18, 2:11:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sweet. was just there a few days ago. Matt can put you to work. Melissa and Matt aren't sticking arounfd?
[2018-06-18, 2:11:47 PM] Jamie: They are instil the 20th of July
[2018-06-18, 2:11:54 PM] Jamie: Until*
[2018-06-18, 2:12:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Beauty. Great location.
[2018-06-18, 2:12:21 PM] Jamie: So I have about 20 days to couch surf but I can always stay in an upper bedroom there too
[2018-06-18, 2:13:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Dan & I have hide-a-beds and hey, you've got a tent ;)
[2018-06-18, 2:13:37 PM] Jamie: Haha that’s true. I’m actually going to Tofino next week too
[2018-06-18, 2:14:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice. Did you bring a board back with you?
[2018-06-18, 2:14:23 PM] Jamie: I did. But I have to drive to Vernon to get it repaired today
[2018-06-18, 2:14:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh airline crunched it?
[2018-06-18, 2:14:46 PM] Jamie: Yeah. Pretty bad this time
[2018-06-18, 2:14:51 PM] Rob Feeny: I took two to Cayman, for me and a friend and they crushed the tail of both
[2018-06-18, 2:15:04 PM] Jamie: Yup. Tails fucked
[2018-06-18, 2:16:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn. No offer to pay for repairs from them?
[2018-06-18, 2:16:36 PM] Jamie: No. It’s pretty clear in the documentation that they are shipped at your own risk
[2018-06-18, 2:16:46 PM] Jamie: Just a cost of doing business.
[2018-06-18, 2:16:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha, like pets
[2018-06-18, 2:17:05 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm surprised they promise to get their passengers there alive
[2018-06-18, 2:17:21 PM] Jamie: Right? Airlines are pretty ruthless
[2018-06-18, 2:21:15 PM] Jamie: Doing anything fun these days?
[2018-06-18, 2:22:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Lots actually. I have 2 motorcycles now, been camping, riding, BBQing
[2018-06-18, 2:22:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Physio is finally letting me run, bike, hike and climb again
[2018-06-18, 2:22:27 PM] Jamie: Awesome!
[2018-06-18, 2:22:29 PM] Rob Feeny: And been spending a few weekends at a friend's working on his cabin
[2018-06-18, 2:22:37 PM] Jamie: Great man.
[2018-06-18, 2:23:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey have you talked ot Dad about the family cabin weekend this year?
[2018-06-18, 2:24:11 PM] Jamie: Nope. I think he is upset with me because I am going to Tofino instead of staying to visit longer after he gets back
[2018-06-18, 2:24:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh
[2018-06-18, 2:24:34 PM] Rob Feeny: figures
[2018-06-18, 2:35:46 PM] Rob Feeny: It's probably foing to be weird to get back on Tofino waves now
[2018-06-18, 2:56:54 PM] Jamie: Yeah I am very curious to see how I do
[2018-06-19, 6:04:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Well I just submitted my 2015, 2016 & 2017 taxes. That was a wild ride.
[2018-06-19, 6:41:48 PM] Jamie: Yikes. Owe anything?
[2018-06-19, 6:42:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. About 5k
[2018-06-19, 6:42:27 PM] Rob Feeny: I've got 4k sitting in the bank but that's got 2018
[2018-06-19, 6:42:46 PM] Rob Feeny: And I used my tax savings for 2017 to pay down my loc
[2018-06-19, 6:43:01 PM] Rob Feeny: So I'll just use that to pay it
[2018-06-19, 6:43:19 PM] Jamie: Makes a certain sort of sense
[2018-06-19, 6:43:29 PM] Rob Feeny: At least it's not looming over me anymore
[2018-06-19, 6:43:48 PM] Rob Feeny: All told I need 41k to be out of debt
[2018-06-19, 6:47:06 PM] Jamie: Including student loans?
[2018-06-19, 6:47:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2018-06-19, 6:48:00 PM] Jamie: Are you chipping away at it?
[2018-06-19, 6:48:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha. Not really.
[2018-06-19, 6:48:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Been very introspective lately. Gotta change cone shit.
[2018-06-19, 6:49:05 PM] Jamie: Like what?
[2018-06-19, 6:50:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Looking at getting a real job. Also going to eliminate sitting in coffee shops. Might buy a membership at a co-working space. The other alternative is to take my settlement I'm getting soon and start that business I've been talking about for 2 yrs
[2018-06-19, 6:50:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Supervans isn't really going anywhere
[2018-06-19, 6:51:28 PM] Jamie: Maybe a real job until you get out of debt might be good
[2018-06-19, 6:52:06 PM] Jamie: Not real progress on Supervans, hey?
[2018-06-19, 6:52:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. I was sad I didn't get that one in Calgary
[2018-06-19, 6:53:06 PM] Jamie: Well at least you are getting an inkling of what you want to do next.
[2018-06-19, 6:53:23 PM] Rob Feeny: And no. I had hoped that by partnering with Morgan I'd be more motivated because he's so nonstop at working, but lately he's very unfocused and I feel solo in the business which is unmotivating
[2018-06-19, 6:53:36 PM] Rob Feeny: He's got a gf that he just wants to spend all his time with
[2018-06-19, 6:53:54 PM] Jamie: Melissa?
[2018-06-19, 6:54:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha
[2018-06-19, 6:54:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Haven't talked with Morgan much?
[2018-06-19, 6:54:35 PM] Jamie: Nope
[2018-06-19, 6:54:41 PM] Jamie: Why what’s up?
[2018-06-19, 6:55:07 PM] Jamie: He never talks about that stuff
[2018-06-19, 6:55:35 PM] Rob Feeny: He's had a girl on the side for a while now. And he is very obvious about it. Like he's either bragging or wants to get caught
[2018-06-19, 6:56:50 PM] Jamie: That’s so weird. He has barely looked at women over the last 15 years that I knew of
[2018-06-19, 6:56:55 PM] Jamie: What’s her name?
[2018-06-19, 6:57:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I know! It was like a sudden change. I had wondered in the past if he had super low sex drive or some mental thing about girls
[2018-06-19, 6:57:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Name is Emily but he calls her sunshine. She lives at Fairmont
[2018-06-19, 6:58:21 PM] Jamie: Oh god. That’s hilarious. And Melissa is pregnant again
[2018-06-19, 6:58:32 PM] Jamie: Is she hot?
[2018-06-19, 6:58:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah heard that through the grapevine too. I can't believe he has sex with her
[2018-06-19, 6:59:33 PM] Rob Feeny: She's cute in a nerdy raver hippy chick way
[2018-06-19, 6:59:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Young with a decent body
[2018-06-19, 7:00:05 PM] Jamie: Well good for him. Mid life crisis with the jeep and a girl on the side
[2018-06-19, 7:01:16 PM] Rob Feeny: It's been interesting to see him develop some interests outside of work and drinking
[2018-06-19, 7:02:52 PM] Rob Feeny: I was totally surprised he came out camping when I invited him
[2018-06-19, 7:03:12 PM] Jamie: No kidding.
[2018-06-19, 7:03:22 PM] Jamie: Oh did you go with Rolando?
[2018-06-19, 7:03:50 PM] Rob Feeny: No it was a couple weeks before, I organized a camping trip and he and Rolando came out
[2018-06-19, 7:04:12 PM] Jamie: He never shows for that stuff
[2018-06-19, 7:04:26 PM] Rob Feeny: That's what I thought!
[2018-06-19, 7:06:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm just floored he knocked up Melissa again
[2018-06-19, 7:06:08 PM] Rob Feeny: 18 years
[2018-06-19, 7:06:46 PM] Jamie: Yup. But he might just leave her and take the kids. No doubt he is a provider.
‎[2018-06-20, 7:29:23 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2018-06-20, 7:30:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy. I bought something from them like 10yrs ago
[2018-06-20, 7:31:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to open it? It's probably just advertising. Most likely just recycling

[2018-06-20, 7:33:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks.
[2018-06-20, 7:33:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Good of them
[2018-06-20, 7:46:14 PM] Jamie: Recycle?
[2018-06-20, 7:48:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep thx
[2018-06-20, 7:48:30 PM] Rob Feeny: It's just name and email the hackers got
[2018-06-20, 7:48:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks
[2018-06-22, 4:29:03 PM] Jamie: How did Supervans go?
[2018-06-22, 4:46:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Actually really well! Super productive day yesterday
[2018-06-22, 4:47:04 PM] Jamie: Nice!
[2018-06-22, 4:50:26 PM] Jamie: When is it supposed to go live?
[2018-06-22, 5:36:27 PM] Rob Feeny: We're submitting the App to the app store next Monday, but I have a few weeks of work to do on the spreadsheet
[2018-06-22, 5:36:43 PM] Rob Feeny: But Rolando is ready to start using the app to reorder
[2018-06-22, 5:36:48 PM] Jamie: Oh shit. Curious to see what will happen
[2018-06-22, 5:40:57 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll invite you the spreadsheet
[2018-06-22, 5:41:11 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2018-06-22, 5:44:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Just meeting w/ Ben
[2018-06-23, 4:34:47 PM] Jamie: Hey me, Morgan And Logan will come by. What time and what should we bring?
[2018-06-23, 4:34:55 PM] Jamie: I didn’t get you a birthday present
[2018-06-23, 4:34:59 PM] Jamie: Lol
[2018-06-23, 4:38:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha bastard
[2018-06-23, 4:38:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Not worried. It'll be later, like 7
[2018-06-23, 4:39:29 PM] Rob Feeny: I wouldn't worry about bringing something
[2018-06-23, 8:21:08 PM] Jamie: Rolling with Morgan. We will be late. Don’t wait, lol
[2018-06-23, 9:31:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha of course. Got any ETA? Otherwise I'll start cooking
[2018-06-23, 9:33:46 PM] Jamie: Not sure. Just waiting for Morgan’s girl to get to Fairmont.
[2018-06-23, 9:34:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha ok thought you were at Fleet. There will be steak for you when you arrive
[2018-06-23, 9:51:51 PM] Jamie: Leaving now
‎[2018-06-23, 9:52:21 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-06-23, 9:54:12 PM] Jamie: Nice!
[2018-06-24, 12:15:25 AM] Jamie: Hey I forgot the French press. And we left a beer in the fridge, can I grab it from you tomorrow morning or you can put it outside your door and I’ll grab it on the way by at 8:30?
‎[2018-06-24, 12:21:57 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-06-24, 12:22:11 AM] Jamie: 👍
[2018-06-28, 5:53:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey did you have a birthday card for me from Dad & Cathy?
[2018-06-28, 5:53:45 PM] Jamie: Yup yup. In my suite case. Forgot to give it to you
[2018-06-29, 11:15:30 AM] Jamie: Hey thanks for the French press. It worked wonders every morning
[2018-06-29, 11:16:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice! I use a mini one every day, love it
[2018-06-29, 11:17:36 AM] Jamie: Cool. What are you doing today? I’m headed to Starbucks
[2018-06-29, 11:19:24 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll be there at some point, this morning I'm picking up my settlement cheque. Then I have accounting work to do before packing for the US
[2018-06-29, 11:20:07 AM] Jamie: Nice. How much is the check?
[2018-06-29, 11:20:20 AM] Rob Feeny: 16k
[2018-06-29, 11:20:48 AM] Jamie: That's got to be a nice feeling
[2018-06-29, 11:20:50 AM] Rob Feeny: About 4k more than I was expecting
[2018-06-29, 11:22:25 AM] Rob Feeny: It is. I also recently sorted out all my past taxes etc so it's a nice feeling to know I have nothing hanging over my head
[2018-06-29, 11:22:45 AM] Rob Feeny: No more of the "I'm just not looking at that" feeling
[2018-06-29, 11:24:53 AM] Rob Feeny: When will you make it to Starbucks?
[2018-06-29, 11:41:07 AM] Jamie: That’s great about the taxes
[2018-06-29, 11:44:21 AM] Jamie: I’m here now
[2018-06-29, 11:45:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Ah ok, I might be there at like 1130
[2018-06-29, 12:27:39 PM] Rob Feeny: $17,166. Yipes
[2018-06-29, 12:27:56 PM] Jamie: Sweeeeeeeeeeeet
[2018-06-29, 12:28:08 PM] Jamie: An extra grand never hurts
[2018-06-29, 12:28:23 PM] Rob Feeny: I was expecting 12k so yay that's nice
[2018-06-29, 1:18:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Got lunch plans yet?
[2018-06-29, 1:19:34 PM] Jamie: I don’t. But just got to fairmont to do some studying and have to meet Paul at 2 in Commercial. Rain check?
[2018-06-29, 1:19:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2018-06-30, 1:37:36 PM] Jamie: Good morning Rob. Is it cool if I crash on your couch for the next couple nights?
[2018-06-30, 1:38:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Actually starting tomorrow I have some German friends that are crashing there for two nights
[2018-06-30, 1:38:30 PM] Jamie: OK then just tonight would be great
[2018-06-30, 11:04:54 PM] Jamie: Hey what’s your wifi?
[2018-06-30, 11:07:21 PM] Rob Feeny: It's written in the white board in the kitchen
[2018-06-30, 11:07:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Is the party over already?
[2018-06-30, 11:08:21 PM] Jamie: Kids are screaming, adults are playing a card game. I’m one the couch, lol
[2018-06-30, 11:08:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok well I can give you the password to Morgan's Netflix if you want to zone out haha
[2018-06-30, 11:09:22 PM] Jamie: I kept my account but thanks. Running tomorrow so bedtime soon
[2018-06-30, 11:09:27 PM] Jamie: How’s the crew?
[2018-06-30, 11:13:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Great. Beveraging. Huge BBQ dinner.

[2018-07-01, 12:01:06 AM] Jamie: Place looks great man!
[2018-07-01, 12:04:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Thanks, been chipping away at it
[2018-07-01, 12:07:05 AM] Jamie: Any chance of an extra pillow somewhere?
[2018-07-01, 12:08:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah the closet in my room. Did you open the couch to find the bedding? Should be 2 in there
[2018-07-01, 12:09:14 AM] Rob Feeny: The couch pulls out into a hide a bed, all the bedding is stored inside it
[2018-07-01, 12:09:53 AM] Jamie: Ahh I didn’t. Just laying on the couch. Cool will grab, thanks
[2018-07-01, 12:18:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha enjoy
[2018-07-03, 10:09:08 PM] Rob Feeny: So it coach you sleeping on these days?
[2018-07-03, 10:13:32 PM] Jamie: I’m at Fairmont until Thursday. Actually pretty good here. A couple of my Aussie friends from Nicaragua are stayin here for a month
[2018-07-03, 10:14:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh sweet, sounds fun
[2018-07-03, 10:14:23 PM] Rob Feeny: How are Emily and Jane?
[2018-07-03, 10:38:39 PM] Jamie: So odd. And Emily is not so friendly to the Aussies.
[2018-07-04, 12:01:22 PM] Jamie: Hey I was thinking we should go for a beer but I have something tonight tomorrow night and Friday night. Doing anything Saturday night?
[2018-07-04, 12:03:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm in Kelowna, leave Friday night. Thursday?
[2018-07-04, 12:18:08 PM] Jamie: I really have to spend the day tomorrow working on my prep course and I’ve got something at 4 PM until late. Maybe when you get back
[2018-07-04, 12:32:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sounds good. I need that birthday card at some point!
[2018-07-06, 4:29:50 PM] Jamie: Hey man can you grab my bank cards (Scotia and Royal Bank) from dads?
[2018-07-06, 4:45:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2018-07-06, 4:45:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to message him too? He's more organized than me haha
[2018-07-06, 4:45:50 PM] Jamie: Sure will do.
[2018-07-09, 11:39:15 AM] Rob Feeny: You going to be around Fairmont at any point today?
‎[2018-07-09, 1:08:50 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2018-07-09, 1:10:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Still do. He's got a few great new singles out
[2018-07-09, 1:11:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Tempted to go to that but it will be right after the family cabin weekend and I'm already spending too much money
‎[2018-07-12, 10:06:52 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-07-12, 10:06:54 AM] Rob Feeny: It's like modern art!
[2018-07-12, 10:07:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Something tells me I'm not getting my 12" of separation
[2018-07-12, 10:08:00 AM] Jamie: Oh geez. Where is this?
[2018-07-12, 10:08:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Deep Maple ridge on some monstrous East Indian build
[2018-07-12, 10:08:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Sloppy
[2018-07-12, 10:13:34 AM] Rob Feeny: Is it bad that the Shaw/Telus demarc is on the other side of the plywood from the panel? Won't that give a ton of EMF interference?
[2018-07-12, 10:13:52 AM] Rob Feeny: (plus make it impossible for me to come in the back of the box)
[2018-07-12, 10:25:20 AM] Jamie: I don’t think so. Is it plastic? The box?
[2018-07-12, 10:26:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Yes
[2018-07-12, 10:45:05 AM] Jamie: Something about the wires being parallel to the magnetic flux is bad. So a low-voltage line in parallel to a high-voltage line is really bad anything off of that is better
[2018-07-12, 11:11:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool. Can I use standard electrical staples for LV? Or do I have to put them in and zip tie to them? We always used saddles and zip ties with Morgan
[2018-07-12, 11:13:55 AM] Jamie: Have to zip tie. Works better anyway. You can put the staples in with a loose tie and pull a bundle through it. Better for 1 person
[2018-07-12, 11:14:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Awesome thanks
[2018-07-12, 11:28:53 AM] Jamie: Still going for dinner / beer tonight?
[2018-07-12, 11:37:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Yup, should be home around 6ish, ideas on where to go? Cotto has beer again! But the food...
[2018-07-12, 11:38:35 AM] Jamie: Yeah I want cheap too. About Exide?
[2018-07-12, 11:38:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Sold
[2018-07-12, 6:52:57 PM] Jamie: Just working on Commercial. Think you will be around that time?
[2018-07-12, 6:59:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll be home for sure by 615, need a quick shower, out the door by 630. Just packing up tools.
[2018-07-12, 7:00:06 PM] Jamie: OK
[2018-07-22, 11:18:38 AM] Jamie: Hey do you want to come 4 x 4 Ing with Morgan and I today?
[2018-07-22, 11:46:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Sorry man Morgan had already invited me but I had plans set already
[2018-07-22, 11:52:45 AM] Jamie: No worries
[2018-07-23, 10:20:57 AM] Rob Feeny: So it looks like I can split the light and fan in my bathroom, but do you know of any single gang double switches where one is a dimmer? I only found a lutron one for $70
[2018-07-23, 10:21:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Otherwise I'm looking at cutting some tile, pulling out the device box and putting in a double gang retro box
[2018-07-23, 10:21:36 AM] Jamie: Wow I’m suprised that they even make one. That’s a lot to fit in a JB
[2018-07-23, 10:21:51 AM] Rob Feeny: The wiring is nice and sketchy, the fan power switched from loomex to cab tire somewhere inside the ceiling
[2018-07-23, 10:22:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok, cutting it is!
[2018-07-23, 10:22:37 AM] Jamie: It’s a nightmare pulling out one box and adding a larger one dude!
[2018-07-23, 10:23:04 AM] Jamie: The box is probably nailed to the stud
[2018-07-23, 10:23:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah I figured it would be. I'm expecting to have to cut the box in pieces
[2018-07-23, 10:23:54 AM] Rob Feeny: And thought I could get my oscillating multitool in there to cut the nails
[2018-07-23, 10:24:21 AM] Jamie: That’s true. I guess if you have the tools and the time, it will work
[2018-07-23, 10:24:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh I figured out why the fan is so shitty too. They installed it in a way that the internal flap was blocked and not opening when the fan turned on
[2018-07-23, 10:25:01 AM] Jamie: Or replace the fan with a motion sensor one and send constant power to it
[2018-07-23, 10:25:14 AM] Rob Feeny: So it's basically been blowing air at a closed flap all these years
[2018-07-23, 10:25:32 AM] Jamie: Haha it will be great to fix that finally
[2018-07-23, 10:26:19 AM] Rob Feeny: I think it's replace the whole fan time, even unblocked it's loud
[2018-07-23, 10:26:27 AM] Rob Feeny: But less loud
[2018-07-23, 10:36:43 AM] Jamie: You could just do an motion sensor one but they may not be cheaper.

[2018-07-27, 1:25:51 PM] Rob Feeny: That's to code, right?
[2018-07-27, 1:26:32 PM] Jamie: I think it needs another tire up in a plastic bag and you should be good to go!
[2018-07-27, 1:26:49 PM] Jamie: Ha ha where is this?
[2018-07-27, 1:27:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Some old Italian dude's place in Burnaby near my place
[2018-07-27, 1:27:19 PM] Rob Feeny: West coast AV job
[2018-07-28, 2:58:42 PM] Jamie: Hey I’m having trouble with the decision to keep my truck or sell it. Could use your analytical brain, if you don’t mind. Can you see any reason why I should or shouldn’t keep it? I’m pretty attached to it as a safety net if I have to do any electrical jobs but I have no real interns in that at this point.
[2018-07-28, 2:58:56 PM] Jamie: But I could probably sell it for $15k
[2018-07-28, 3:00:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Where do you see yourself living after this course?
[2018-07-28, 3:01:49 PM] Rob Feeny: To be honest, it's a large, expensive vehicle. It's safe, comfortable and a known risk, but if you're looking to save money and be mobile, I'd probably sell it in your position.
[2018-07-28, 3:02:05 PM] Rob Feeny: You can rent something for an electrical job for way less than you'd spend keeping the truck
[2018-07-28, 3:02:06 PM] Jamie: Either I go to Ecuador for 3 months or Victoria. It is possible I stay here but only if this course leads me to something immediately
[2018-07-28, 3:02:20 PM] Rob Feeny: My sedan costs me next to nothing
[2018-07-28, 3:02:45 PM] Jamie: That’s what I’m thinking. Evo is about $7 an hour if needed but I think I could take the bus lots
[2018-07-28, 3:03:15 PM] Jamie: Yeah $179 for insurance and gas so far has been $300 plus an oil change and other maintenance
[2018-07-28, 3:03:46 PM] Jamie: The other thing I could do is buy an older Toyota
[2018-07-28, 3:03:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a spare motorcycle too if you want to take a girl on a date haha
[2018-07-28, 3:04:12 PM] Jamie: Haha thanks.
[2018-07-28, 3:04:19 PM] Rob Feeny: I pay 140 a month for commercial insurance and gas is probably half what your truck is
[2018-07-28, 3:04:44 PM] Jamie: And you are generatin income using it
[2018-07-28, 3:06:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes, but if I wasn't using it for work, it would be very little gas and very low carrying costs
[2018-07-28, 3:07:02 PM] Jamie: True. Also little things that I always fixed are breaking and I don’t want to spend the money on upkeep these days. I think you are right Rob
[2018-07-28, 3:11:40 PM] Jamie: Thx
[2018-07-28, 3:12:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Hard to do, but I think you just needed someone to confirm what you were feeling
[2018-07-28, 3:12:25 PM] Jamie: Yeah somebody without my attachment
[2018-07-29, 10:30:46 AM] Rob Feeny: You coming 4x4ing?
[2018-07-29, 10:30:55 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2018-07-29, 10:31:08 AM] Jamie: Meeting Morgan at his place for 10am
[2018-07-29, 10:31:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Beauty and to Am's birthday after?
[2018-07-29, 10:31:22 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2018-07-29, 10:32:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Cool, see you at Morgan's then
[2018-07-29, 10:33:04 AM] Jamie: Sounds good Rob
[2018-07-29, 10:59:01 AM] Jamie: Want me to swing by and grab you?
[2018-07-29, 10:59:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Sure, if you've got time
[2018-07-29, 10:59:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Know if we're still doing Rommer's?
[2018-07-29, 11:00:24 AM] Jamie: No we aren’t. I ate.
[2018-07-29, 11:01:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok, I'll find some food
[2018-07-29, 11:12:11 AM] Jamie: Should I grab you before or after I grab a coffee?
[2018-07-29, 11:13:58 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll be ready in 10min
[2018-07-29, 11:14:28 AM] Jamie: I’m still 20 minutes away but I was going to stop for coffee first if you don’t want one
[2018-07-29, 11:14:49 AM] Rob Feeny: I've already had one, go ahead
[2018-07-29, 11:37:13 AM] Jamie: Here

[2018-07-30, 9:34:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yah you're in class. Hope it's going well
[2018-07-30, 9:40:21 PM] Jamie: Yeah it’s good but I’m here for a while longer
[2018-07-30, 9:41:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok no stress

[2018-08-12, 8:18:31 PM] Rob Feeny: You're right. It was a bitch, but it's done.
[2018-08-12, 8:18:55 PM] Rob Feeny: The weird thing is, I swear the lights, on max, aren't as bright as they were on just a basic switch...
[2018-08-12, 8:19:05 PM] Rob Feeny: But maybe it's all in my head
[2018-08-12, 8:28:21 PM] Jamie: Is it a dimmable bulb?
[2018-08-12, 8:28:28 PM] Jamie: Looks good!
[2018-08-12, 8:28:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Incandescent
[2018-08-12, 8:28:40 PM] Rob Feeny: 3x 60w
[2018-08-12, 8:28:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Or 40w?
‎[2018-08-12, 8:28:55 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-08-12, 8:29:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks. What a chore
[2018-08-12, 8:29:14 PM] Jamie: 40w I think.
[2018-08-12, 8:29:34 PM] Jamie: Haha yeah I bet. Wires from the top and bottom?
[2018-08-12, 8:29:53 PM] Jamie: Hey man that’s a job most people couldn’t do. You should feel proud
[2018-08-12, 8:33:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope everything from the top, just really short ones. Had to modify the box to get it in the hole. There's about 1/4" clearance from the hole to the edges of the plate but I didn't want a goof plate
[2018-08-12, 8:33:50 PM] Rob Feeny: But yay, no more loud fan
[2018-08-12, 8:35:14 PM] Rob Feeny: It actually took like every freaking power tool I had. Grinder, Recip, Multitool, Dremel, Impact Driver, Vacuum
[2018-08-12, 8:35:40 PM] Jamie: Lol
[2018-08-16, 5:33:30 PM] Rob Feeny: So are you living out of your backpack right now? Might have a friend looking to borrow one overnight this weekend but my second one is too small
[2018-08-16, 6:05:33 PM] Jamie: I think it’s empty actually
[2018-08-16, 6:06:50 PM] Rob Feeny: If she does need it, any chance I could grab it tomorrow eve?
[2018-08-16, 6:17:26 PM] Jamie: Sure. When though? I’m in class until about 8 and home by 9
[2018-08-16, 6:17:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok that could work. I have no plans tomorrow night beside packing for the hike
[2018-08-16, 8:37:57 PM] Jamie: Sure. What time you done?
[2018-08-16, 9:51:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Not quite sure, I'm working in deep Chilliwack and not sure how  when I'm done. But I'll be done before you
[2018-08-16, 9:55:54 PM] Jamie: Ok let me know maybe you can grab me from downtown and give me a ride home, grab a beer on the way
[2018-08-17, 7:10:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn, she just cancelled, she's ill. Rain check on the beer? Need sleeeeep
[2018-08-17, 7:25:45 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2018-08-27, 6:23:33 PM] Jamie: How was the hike?
[2018-08-27, 6:23:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Epically difficult but enjoyable. Took me days to recover.
[2018-08-27, 6:24:02 PM] Rob Feeny: How's school?
[2018-08-27, 6:31:04 PM] Jamie: Glad you had a good time. How many people?
[2018-08-27, 6:31:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Just 5 of us. Vanessa almost died. She was struggling
[2018-08-27, 6:31:32 PM] Jamie: And it’s an emotional roller coaster. So many hours in a day and impossible to keep up.
[2018-08-27, 6:31:46 PM] Rob Feeny: But the swim in a mountain lake was great and I was in better shape than last time.
[2018-08-27, 6:31:56 PM] Jamie: Shit. But she pulled through I guess
[2018-08-27, 6:35:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Was ready to murder Andrew for convincing her to come
[2018-08-27, 6:36:04 PM] Jamie: Ahhh the things we do for love, lol. Who else went?
[2018-08-27, 6:58:42 PM] Rob Feeny: My friends Christina and Devin from University
[2018-08-27, 7:13:25 PM] Rob Feeny: You surviving?
[2018-08-27, 7:16:22 PM] Jamie: Sometimes.  It’s a very hard thing, psychologically, to be 5 assignments behind by the first week. 11 by the second week and 16 by the 3rd week.
[2018-08-27, 7:16:36 PM] Jamie: Totally demotivating.
[2018-08-27, 7:16:54 PM] Jamie: But I’m learning a lot in a short time
[2018-08-27, 7:17:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap. And they're all due at the end of the course?
[2018-08-27, 7:17:49 PM] Jamie: Theoretically. But you don’t get a diploma or anything so...
[2018-08-27, 7:17:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha ok ok
[2018-08-27, 7:18:09 PM] Jamie: And I failed the first test
[2018-08-27, 7:18:16 PM] Rob Feeny: So there's no proof to employers that you completed the course?
[2018-08-27, 7:18:54 PM] Jamie: Oh maybe we get something but the reference from the school is the main thing
[2018-08-27, 7:19:16 PM] Jamie: But 3 out of 4 people are in the same spot as me
[2018-08-27, 7:19:42 PM] Jamie: So I’m not just really bad at coding, this is part of the plan 🤷‍♂️
[2018-08-27, 7:21:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok. It's sink or swim.
[2018-08-27, 7:21:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Got any other courses lined up after this?
[2018-08-27, 7:21:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I've got a reasonably simple app idea if you're looking for something to code
[2018-08-27, 7:22:15 PM] Jamie: Nah. I think I will hang in Vancouver/Kelowna until November and the. Go to Ecuador to work on my own apps. I would be happy to try to code yours
[2018-08-27, 7:22:24 PM] Jamie: What’s the idea?
[2018-08-27, 7:23:12 PM] Rob Feeny: It's for people like me that suffer from Paralysis by Analysis and have trouble deciding what is higher priority.
[2018-08-27, 7:23:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Not sure if I've told you about it before
[2018-08-27, 7:23:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Basically you input or import a list of tasks, it forces you to decide between random tasks, simple A vs B and uses your answers to sort the list
[2018-08-27, 7:24:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Pop-ups that show you two tasks and you can say A is more important (or much more important) than B
[2018-08-27, 7:25:03 PM] Rob Feeny: So it throws them at you fast so you have to make a snap decision before it replaces it with another and after a few minutes you have your tasks in order of importance
[2018-08-27, 7:25:48 PM] Jamie: Sounds pretty simple. Import from where?
[2018-08-27, 7:26:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Either you type them in or just paste from wherever you've copied them from
[2018-08-27, 7:26:20 PM] Jamie: Sounds fun to make
[2018-08-27, 7:26:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Or you could get fancy and allow apps to share a list, like Trello or Keep, but the simple way is just a copy of the data, each item in a separate line
[2018-08-27, 7:27:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Then the app lets you share the results or copy it to the clipboard
[2018-08-27, 7:28:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I was descansen making the app with a virtual assistant I've used a lot of India but we never really did anything with it
[2018-08-28, 12:31:24 PM] Jamie: Yeah I was thinking about it and me creating the app wouldn’t help you. It would be for iOS, lol
[2018-08-28, 12:38:16 PM] Rob Feeny: No way to port it over?
[2018-08-28, 12:38:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Or make it a web app?
[2018-08-28, 12:39:40 PM] Jamie: Maybe in some sort of web iOS emulator. I’ll think about it. Apparently there is a program called react native that does both android and iOS dev
[2018-08-28, 12:42:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Interesting. But honestly, I most suggested it because it can be hard to think of an idea for an app
[2018-08-28, 1:02:11 PM] Jamie: Cool. I will try it anyway. Thanks for the idea
[2018-08-28, 5:45:35 PM] Jamie: https://www.amazon.ca/goTenna-Location-Information-Weatherproof-Compatible/dp/B0721B8M3J/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=sports&ie=UTF8&qid=1535496303&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=goTenna+G%2BB+-+text+%26+GPS+on+your+phone%2C+no+service+required
[2018-08-28, 5:48:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow that's pretty crazy
[2018-08-28, 5:48:24 PM] Rob Feeny: d lots of talk of mesh networks in the past but I've never seen anybody actually implemented a usable one
[2018-08-28, 5:48:57 PM] Jamie: Seems like a cool idea though c
[2018-08-28, 5:49:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah 4 miles of range is actually pretty huge
[2018-08-28, 5:50:11 PM] Jamie: Totally. Would cover most surf towns or camp ground perfectly
[2018-08-28, 5:51:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Or in basement room where you can pick up cell phone service
[2018-08-28, 5:51:44 PM] Jamie: Good point.
[2018-08-28, 5:51:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry my voice to text is shit
[2018-08-28, 5:51:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Just driving back from Chilliwack
[2018-09-05, 8:39:40 PM] Jamie: Not making it to be pizza thing tonight? I’m wrapping up at school and was going to head over there. Was hoping to see you
[2018-09-05, 8:40:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry man, doing about 4 projects at once atm
[2018-09-05, 8:40:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Got to finish a PowerPoint
[2018-09-05, 8:48:18 PM] Jamie: Ok no worries.
[2018-09-05, 8:48:28 PM] Jamie: Making money?
[2018-09-05, 9:08:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, the CSA certification contract is a good oe
[2018-09-05, 9:08:29 PM] Rob Feeny: One
[2018-09-05, 9:08:36 PM] Rob Feeny: $4700
[2018-09-05, 9:20:12 PM] Jamie: Thats sweet man. Happy to hear you found a niche
[2018-09-05, 9:22:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Sadly it's a very small niche
[2018-09-05, 9:22:45 PM] Jamie: Perhaps even...
[2018-09-05, 9:22:53 PM] Jamie: tiny?
[2018-09-05, 9:23:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh. You didn't.
[2018-09-05, 9:23:10 PM] Jamie: 😎
[2018-09-05, 9:23:11 PM] Rob Feeny: 😔
[2018-09-13, 6:45:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey are you heading to Galiano Island next weekend?
[2018-09-13, 9:06:35 PM] Jamie: No I can’t get away from school
[2018-09-13, 9:06:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Sucks man
‎[2018-09-13, 9:10:37 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-09-13, 9:10:52 PM] Rob Feeny: repping the Feeny Power brand
[2018-09-13, 9:11:53 PM] Jamie: Haha nice
[2018-09-13, 9:12:02 PM] Jamie: Where are you?
[2018-09-13, 9:27:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Brew Hall, where Steel Toad used to be
[2018-09-16, 5:18:28 PM] Jamie: You may get a code for TD bank, if you could send it my way
[2018-09-16, 8:48:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry, was off on an island all weekend
[2018-09-16, 10:49:23 PM] Jamie: No worries. How was it?
[2018-09-16, 11:20:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Wet! But good. Got lots done. Yours? That code did come in, you still need it?
[2018-09-16, 11:21:05 PM] Jamie: It expires after an hour. Tomorrow I can try again
[2018-09-16, 11:22:00 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍
[2018-09-18, 4:57:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugh. Oldness us beginning. I can't focus on things super close to me any longer.
[2018-09-18, 4:57:25 PM] Rob Feeny: *is
[2018-09-18, 4:58:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll cry if I need glasses for reading
[2018-09-18, 4:59:04 PM] Jamie: Oh shit. I was just thinking that the other day except long distance seems to be blurrier
[2018-09-18, 4:59:37 PM] Rob Feeny: I had my head in a small space trying to read a serial number and had to take a photo instead
[2018-09-20, 2:51:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Can I use a 3way dimmer as a single pole?
[2018-09-20, 2:53:39 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2018-09-20, 2:53:53 PM] Jamie: Just meter the terminals to determine which one works
[2018-09-20, 2:54:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Sweet, just scored a couple freebie lutron dimmers
[2018-09-20, 2:54:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks
[2018-09-20, 2:54:34 PM] Jamie: No worries. Good score
[2018-09-20, 2:55:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Surviving?
[2018-09-20, 2:57:40 PM] Jamie: Yeah no more assignments!
[2018-09-20, 2:58:09 PM] Jamie: The next 2.5 weeks are all about the final project. We are doing augmented reality mini golf. So stoked
[2018-09-20, 2:58:42 PM] Jamie: How about you?
[2018-09-20, 2:59:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Crazy, I look forward to checking it out
[2018-09-20, 2:59:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Each of you doing a piece?
[2018-09-20, 2:59:19 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm doing well. Lots of exercise, work and friends
[2018-09-20, 3:53:46 PM] Jamie: Nice to hear. Well 2 of us are working on some parts together and splitting up other parts as we get into it
[2018-09-20, 3:55:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Like real life
[2018-09-24, 10:24:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Doing Thanksgiving dinner @ Dan & Janice's on the 7th if you're around
[2018-09-25, 6:01:22 PM] Jamie: Yeah that would be great
[2018-10-03, 7:41:59 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob hows life?
[2018-10-03, 7:45:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Good man. Busy. You?
[2018-10-03, 7:46:34 PM] Jamie: Getting ready to be done this course on Friday. Making money?
[2018-10-03, 7:49:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah some. And keeping happy and healthy. Spent Monday and Tues fixing the sewer at my suite with a plumber
[2018-10-03, 7:50:27 PM] Jamie: Emergency fix?

[2018-10-03, 7:51:35 PM] Jamie: Oh shit. Right where your garden was
[2018-10-03, 8:00:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha literally shit
[2018-10-03, 8:09:26 PM] Jamie: I’m nervous about Thanksgiving. You mentioned to Dan and Janice I might be there?
[2018-10-03, 8:22:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes, I didn't realize there was as much tension there. Maybe it would be a good time to smooth things?
[2018-10-03, 8:27:11 PM] Jamie: Probably. I might have to go to Calgary for a month to renovate my condo in a couple weeks then Ecuador so probably last chance to see them
‎[2018-10-03, 8:29:52 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2018-10-03, 9:00:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure I could use them, thanks
[2018-10-03, 9:00:54 PM] Rob Feeny: How's that condo doing?
[2018-10-03, 9:02:06 PM] Jamie: Little beat up after so many years but it’s still a good place. It would be nice to at least get the paint and carpet done while I can. Tenant gave notice for the end of this month b
[2018-10-03, 9:02:23 PM] Jamie: Road trip? Lol
[2018-10-03, 9:04:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I really need to work on making money the next few months
[2018-10-03, 9:05:14 PM] Rob Feeny: If we could break it over a long weekend?
[2018-10-03, 9:05:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Would it really take a month?
[2018-10-03, 9:06:23 PM] Jamie: Man I was joking. A 10 hr drive into snow in Calgary? I’m not sure that sounds fun anymore
[2018-10-03, 9:06:36 PM] Jamie: I’m actually kind of looking forward to it. I have everything I need to camp in my condo.
[2018-10-03, 9:06:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha awesome
[2018-10-03, 9:06:58 PM] Rob Feeny: And I'm sure the snow won't stick around
[2018-10-03, 9:07:20 PM] Jamie: And no. The paint and carpet, maybe a week but if I can’t rent it I will do the countertops and then work to get it rented
[2018-10-03, 9:07:34 PM] Jamie: The next month
[2018-10-03, 9:09:20 PM] Rob Feeny: It's not like you're paying expenses here in Vancouver so why not
[2018-10-03, 9:10:03 PM] Jamie: Exactly. This might be the only time I have to get it done too
[2018-10-03, 9:14:50 PM] Rob Feeny: True
[2018-10-03, 9:14:59 PM] Rob Feeny: And back to Ecuador for November?
[2018-10-03, 9:15:50 PM] Jamie: Well November would be the month I would be in Calgary so December. Just when it’s getting hot there
[2018-10-03, 9:15:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah true
[2018-10-04, 11:10:36 AM] Jamie: Hey Any chance I can get you to mail the keys to my condo to Darren in Calgary? They are in the folder for that property in my files. I can grab them Monday but sooner is better
[2018-10-04, 11:19:35 AM] Rob Feeny: I could probably do it tonight
[2018-10-04, 11:20:56 AM] Jamie: If you could, that would be awesome. My tenant is too busy to meet the carpet estimator so Darren said he could do it but he doesn’t have keys.
[2018-10-04, 8:18:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a tip on which box they'd be in?
[2018-10-04, 8:19:26 PM] Jamie: The Jamie Feeny Persia always I think is only 1. Sorry at my presentation, I can call around 8?
[2018-10-04, 8:19:38 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2018-10-04, 8:19:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Good luck
‎[2018-10-04, 8:25:16 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-10-04, 8:28:20 PM] Jamie: Awesome. If you can fastest possible.
[2018-10-04, 9:37:09 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a long weekend, Tuesday is the best they can do
[2018-10-04, 9:37:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Does that work?
[2018-10-04, 9:37:40 PM] Jamie: Oh that’s great man!  Appreciate it very much
[2018-10-04, 9:37:42 PM] Rob Feeny: It'll be about $30
[2018-10-04, 9:37:49 PM] Jamie: Cool

[2018-10-04, 9:56:56 PM] Jamie: Thanks dude. I owe ya. I talked to dan about thanksgiving so not so awkward.
[2018-10-04, 9:57:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Glad to hear it
[2018-10-04, 9:57:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Going to make it then?
[2018-10-04, 10:16:09 PM] Jamie: Yeah you bet
[2018-10-04, 10:17:40 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2018-10-05, 12:20:24 AM] Jamie: I can give you cash on Sunday. Hope you wrote that off!
[2018-10-05, 12:22:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Of course ;)
[2018-10-09, 12:14:14 PM] Jamie: Hey I forgot to give you your cash. Email money transfer or meet for a beer this week and I have it in my wallet?
[2018-10-09, 1:03:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Pretty busy week, tbh, won't be free until sat. When do you leave for ktown?
[2018-10-09, 1:16:01 PM] Jamie: Just booked my ride for the 17th. 1 week tomorrow
[2018-10-09, 1:33:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2018-10-10, 9:23:10 AM] Jamie: Hey that tracking number doesn’t seem to work and one of the option is tracking wasn’t included. Darren hasn’t gotten the keys yet. That possible?
[2018-10-10, 9:46:01 AM] Rob Feeny: Really? The Canada Post guy said there was tracking, it was the most expensive, fastest option
[2018-10-10, 9:46:26 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm at a job but will pass by home in about 2 hours, I'll grab the paperwork and go see them
[2018-10-10, 9:48:12 AM] Jamie: Oh thats ok. I can call them. I punched in the number and it gave me 5 potential reason why they have no tracking info, that was one of them. Just making sure before I call
[2018-10-10, 9:48:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Well he gave me the receipt and then almost an afterthought said oh and here's your tracking
[2018-10-10, 9:49:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Young guy, seemed to really know
[2018-10-10, 10:03:00 AM] Jamie: Ok I was entering the wrong number. Of course it said that number was valid but unable to track. More corporate bull crap. The other number worked and it has been in Calgary since the 8th. Not sure why they didn’t deliver it yesterday
[2018-10-10, 10:20:15 AM] Rob Feeny: Very strange. We can apply for a refund of the fee, it was guaranteed 2 days I think
[2018-10-10, 5:24:56 PM] Jamie: Any chance you can send me a code if you get it?
[2018-10-10, 5:25:37 PM] Rob Feeny: 420690
[2018-10-10, 5:27:28 PM] Rob Feeny: 970695
[2018-10-10, 5:29:21 PM] Jamie: Thanks. Got my number set up in there now.
[2018-10-10, 7:03:28 PM] Rob Feeny: any update on the keys?
[2018-10-10, 7:25:07 PM] Jamie: Yup they go there. Thanks dude
[2018-10-10, 7:27:04 PM] Rob Feeny: When did they arrive? We could probably complain and get all the money back
[2018-10-14, 1:30:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a second for a tech question?
[2018-10-14, 1:31:11 PM] Jamie: Sure what’s up?
[2018-10-14, 1:31:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Trying to wire this Lutron 3way dimmer as 2way
[2018-10-14, 1:31:50 PM] Rob Feeny: But no matter what wire I connect to hot, all the other leads are hot when the switch is off
[2018-10-14, 1:32:14 PM] Jamie: Pic?

[2018-10-14, 1:34:04 PM] Jamie: So black should go to the hot wire
[2018-10-14, 1:34:24 PM] Jamie: The reds would be your travellers
[2018-10-14, 1:35:42 PM] Rob Feeny: It's on a switch leg, my white is hot. When i connect the black to the hot, even when the switch is off, both reds are hot
[2018-10-14, 1:37:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, figured it out. The tic tester says one of the reds is hot, but when I connect it to the hot, no power flows to the light??
[2018-10-14, 1:37:13 PM] Jamie: What are you using to test voltage?
‎[2018-10-14, 1:37:27 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-10-14, 1:37:44 PM] Jamie: Yeah the voltage is so small that the tech tested picks it up. That dimmer can never be turned off it needs the power going through it to power the electronics because it doesn’t have a neutral
[2018-10-14, 1:37:57 PM] Jamie: It’s just a very small amount of power probably three or 4 V
[2018-10-14, 1:38:25 PM] Jamie: Is it working now?
[2018-10-14, 1:38:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok that makes sense
[2018-10-14, 1:38:38 PM] Rob Feeny: yup, thanks
[2018-10-14, 1:40:06 PM] Jamie: 😕
[2018-10-14, 1:40:08 PM] Jamie: 👍
[2018-10-14, 1:40:19 PM] Jamie: Sorry it was supposed the be thumbs up, lol
[2018-10-14, 1:40:40 PM] Rob Feeny: My place is now slightly more classy 👍🏻
[2018-10-14, 1:41:23 PM] Jamie: Nice. Where’s the dimmer?
[2018-10-14, 1:41:41 PM] Rob Feeny: One in the bar, one in my bedroom. Kitchen and bathroom already have them
[2018-10-14, 1:41:54 PM] Jamie: Place is coming together
[2018-10-14, 1:42:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Poco a poco
[2018-10-14, 1:42:58 PM] Jamie: Had a fun night with Angelica and Brookelynn, Gabe and his brother.
[2018-10-14, 1:43:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha sounds fun. Angelica described it as "we're getting bombed"
[2018-10-14, 1:43:52 PM] Rob Feeny: I haven't seen those two in ages
[2018-10-14, 1:44:41 PM] Jamie: Me neither. Brookelynn is just ... wow. She is incredibly good looking now. Been going to the gym, dressed well
[2018-10-14, 1:45:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Crazy. Still dating the guy in England?
[2018-10-14, 1:45:06 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2018-10-14, 1:45:24 PM] Jamie: She’s always had a distant boyfriend as long as I’ve known her
[2018-10-14, 1:45:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Kudos to her, that's tough
[2018-10-14, 1:45:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha long distance makes things that shouldn't work, work 😬
[2018-10-14, 1:50:04 PM] Jamie: Feeling pretty rough today. Beers the last 3 days, hard on my body. And didn’t get home until 1 last night
[2018-10-14, 1:50:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yikes. I only had two at Morgan's, then 4 last night. Then sweated it out at Yoga this am
[2018-10-14, 1:50:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to go get drunk tonight? 🤣
[2018-10-14, 1:51:08 PM] Jamie: Might happen. BBQ at Fleet, see Logan and hang with them before I leave
[2018-10-14, 1:51:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Dangerous haha. I'd come but I have my meditation class
[2018-10-15, 6:53:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Don't worry about paying me for the shipping, they're mailing me a cheque
[2018-10-15, 6:53:42 PM] Jamie: Haha ok thanks man. Nice work

[2018-10-20, 7:50:04 PM] Rob Feeny: The LV diagram for this... Place?
[2018-10-20, 7:50:12 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't even know how to describe it
[2018-10-20, 7:51:38 PM] Jamie: Commercial?
[2018-10-20, 7:51:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Free for a call?
[2018-10-20, 7:52:03 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2018-10-20, 7:52:18 PM] Rob Feeny: One sec
[2018-10-29, 6:48:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey do you remember your Gescan sign-in? Just trying to get an idea of prices
[2018-10-29, 6:50:14 PM] Jamie: You could try jamie@feenypower.ca
[2018-10-29, 6:50:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Pass?
[2018-10-29, 6:50:53 PM] Jamie: Password would be number one C AMBRIDGEG

[2018-10-29, 6:52:31 PM] Rob Feeny: damn doesn't look like it works

[2018-10-29, 6:53:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Btw, update to the job debacle

[2018-10-29, 6:54:28 PM] Jamie: Haha looks homeless
[2018-10-29, 6:54:39 PM] Rob Feeny: The client says he showed up this morning, they think he was drunk, to get some ladders
[2018-10-29, 6:54:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Then passed out in his truck
[2018-10-29, 6:55:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Not sure what to believe, but it would explain a lot
[2018-10-29, 6:55:48 PM] Jamie: What the heck
[2018-10-29, 6:55:59 PM] Jamie: #1Cambridgeg
[2018-10-29, 6:57:01 PM] Rob Feeny: ha beauty it worked
[2018-10-29, 6:57:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Still got 3 items in your shopping cart, man!
[2018-10-29, 7:01:47 PM] Jamie: No buying on my credit
[2018-10-29, 7:02:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha do you still have credit there?
[2018-10-29, 7:02:10 PM] Jamie: I shouldn’t.
[2018-10-29, 7:02:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Didn't think so. I recall them saying it was a cash account
[2018-10-30, 2:10:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Damnit people at Starbucks still call me Jamie
[2018-10-30, 2:12:16 PM] Jamie: Haha the legend. You wish you were me 😎
[2018-10-30, 2:12:26 PM] Rob Feeny: 🤨
[2018-10-30, 2:12:32 PM] Rob Feeny: You feeling ok?
[2018-10-30, 2:12:44 PM] Jamie: Lol yup just in Revelstike
[2018-10-30, 2:13:08 PM] Rob Feeny: And that explains your hallucinations?
[2018-10-30, 2:13:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Lovely city
[2018-10-30, 2:15:28 PM] Jamie: Haha fuck you
[2018-10-30, 2:15:48 PM] Jamie: Got a ride with a cute girl to Calgary
[2018-10-30, 2:15:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice!
[2018-10-30, 2:16:01 PM] Rob Feeny: For a good price too I bet
[2018-10-30, 2:16:09 PM] Jamie: $70
[2018-10-30, 2:16:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Cheaper than Greyhound (if that were an option!)
[2018-10-30, 2:16:56 PM] Jamie: and faster I’m sure
[2018-11-06, 7:03:31 PM] Jamie: Hey how did it work out with the job?
[2018-11-06, 7:03:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man
[2018-11-06, 7:03:58 PM] Rob Feeny: They patched things back up and it's rolling on
[2018-11-06, 7:04:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Changing every day
[2018-11-06, 7:06:46 PM] Jamie: That’s hilarious. But stressful. Getting paid?
[2018-11-06, 7:07:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, hours after I invoice. Got some cushion now
[2018-11-06, 7:07:34 PM] Rob Feeny: We scaled the job back a lot but now it's creeping back to the original size
[2018-11-06, 7:07:40 PM] Jamie: That’s great man. I know you are counting on that 💰
[2018-11-06, 7:08:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Heck it helps a lot

[2018-11-06, 9:58:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha where are you, in your apartment?
[2018-11-06, 9:58:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks cushy to me
[2018-11-06, 9:59:09 PM] Jamie: Yeah I’ve been sleeping here for a week tomorrow
[2018-11-06, 9:59:49 PM] Jamie: I have oatmeal and peanut butter in the morning using a stolen coffee cup, lol
[2018-11-06, 10:00:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Just think, you worked the last 25 years if your life to be able to enjoy this level of luxury!
[2018-11-06, 10:00:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh your mom side is showing
‎[2018-11-06, 10:16:15 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-11-06, 10:16:28 PM] Rob Feeny: So hard to get a pic
[2018-11-07, 10:29:08 AM] Jamie: That haircut is hilarious
[2018-11-07, 10:30:01 AM] Jamie: And I actually enjoy the simplicity. A better bed would be nice, I think Darren is bringing me a full size air mattress
[2018-11-07, 10:31:45 AM] Jamie: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp1hyY0nWTu/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1lak6495r5o8p
[2018-11-07, 10:31:57 AM] Jamie: This is exactly what I want
[2018-11-07, 10:32:50 AM] Rob Feeny: That would be super easy to build but I think it's more of a prefab structure than a tiny house of Wheels
[2018-11-07, 10:33:14 AM] Rob Feeny: It looks very much like the stuff we used to build at West Coast outbuildings
[2018-11-07, 10:33:55 AM] Rob Feeny: If that were a sledge mounted prefab and not on Wheels I bet we could build that for about 50K
[2018-11-07, 10:38:50 AM] Jamie: I like the loft idea for separation but this size of footprint on a decent lot 👌
[2018-11-07, 1:11:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep I'd say that's 12 feet wide, based on the size of the bed. Technically you could build it on a trailer but the easiest is build it in a shop and just haul it to site to sit on a gravel bed
[2018-11-08, 10:07:45 PM] Jamie: Uggg can’t wait for this day to be over. This condo is stressing me out!
[2018-11-08, 10:07:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha what happened?
[2018-11-08, 10:09:03 PM] Jamie: Just lame contractors. Plumbing company is $136/hr and useless. They quoted me $700 to remove a sink and then come back and install the new one.
[2018-11-08, 10:09:25 PM] Rob Feeny: ,
[2018-11-08, 10:09:28 PM] Jamie: Painter did a mediocre job and when he sent a guy back the guy did a worse job, lol
[2018-11-08, 10:09:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Crap
[2018-11-08, 10:09:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Welcome to the trades?
[2018-11-08, 10:10:06 PM] Rob Feeny: You should see what AV guys charge. They're criminals
[2018-11-08, 10:10:13 PM] Jamie: Yeah. It’s pretty bleak out here, people are suffering with the economy
[2018-11-08, 10:10:36 PM] Rob Feeny: You'd think that would help ..
[2018-11-08, 10:10:38 PM] Jamie: I’m nervous that I’m not going to be able to rent me place even after putting 10k into renos
[2018-11-08, 10:10:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. Not cool.
[2018-11-08, 10:11:14 PM] Rob Feeny: What's killing the economy out there? The death of oil?
[2018-11-08, 10:11:20 PM] Jamie: Yeah it’s scary. I dropped the rent already but I may have to drop another $50 a month
[2018-11-08, 10:11:26 PM] Jamie: Yup.
[2018-11-08, 10:11:49 PM] Jamie: Even Darren is still not gainfully employed
[2018-11-08, 10:12:06 PM] Jamie: What’s up in Vancouver?
[2018-11-08, 10:12:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Yahhhh that was interesting. He's been odd jobbing but no real job
[2018-11-08, 10:12:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Well the economy is booming here...
[2018-11-08, 10:12:30 PM] Jamie: Right? One province away
[2018-11-08, 10:12:54 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm on track for 50 hrs of work this weekend plus Supervans and consulting stuff on the side
[2018-11-08, 10:13:00 PM] Rob Feeny: *week
[2018-11-08, 10:13:02 PM] Jamie: That’s awesome man
[2018-11-08, 10:14:56 PM] Rob Feeny: That not too shabby for someone not making money off materials. With all the hours logged, it's about $3200
[2018-11-08, 10:15:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Heading to yoga soon too. Did you get a bed upgrade yet?
[2018-11-08, 10:15:27 PM] Jamie: Wow. Must be nice to be earning money instead of spending it!
[2018-11-08, 10:15:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Hell yes. Been a while since I've made real money
[2018-11-08, 10:15:42 PM] Jamie: Haha sorta. Darren bought me an air mattress but it lasts for about six hours before I’m on the floor
[2018-11-08, 10:15:50 PM] Jamie: Brought*
[2018-11-08, 10:16:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh crap. Haha only 6 hours for you!
[2018-11-08, 10:16:09 PM] Jamie: Probably scared the crap out of my upstairs neighbour is running a electric pump at three in the morning

[2018-11-08, 10:16:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Party Cat says hi
[2018-11-08, 10:16:27 PM] Jamie: Cat still looks stoned as 🦆

[2018-11-08, 10:16:56 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm about to dose her again
[2018-11-08, 10:17:03 PM] Jamie: Lol.
[2018-11-08, 10:19:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh god does she hate that
[2018-11-08, 10:19:08 PM] Rob Feeny: The sounds are heartbreaking
[2018-11-08, 10:19:36 PM] Jamie: It’s for the best
[2018-11-08, 10:22:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep but it's the sound of pure betrayal
[2018-11-09, 6:17:13 PM] Rob Feeny: So to add to my ridiculous week I'm going to work from 11 p.m. Sunday until 3 a.m. Monday for double time
[2018-11-09, 6:17:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Robert West Coast
[2018-11-09, 6:17:40 PM] Jamie: Not bad at all
[2018-11-09, 6:17:47 PM] Jamie: $90 and hr?
[2018-11-09, 6:18:00 PM] Jamie: What do you charge him?
[2018-11-09, 6:18:04 PM] Rob Feeny: L I'm Billings at you guys at 80 an hour but giving Ricardo 50 an hour
[2018-11-09, 6:18:44 PM] Jamie: Nice little chunk of change for you
[2018-11-09, 6:19:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm going to be a zombie but it'll be worth it
[2018-11-14, 1:40:03 PM] Jamie: Just booked my first week stay in Ecuador at a homestay. 😬
[2018-11-14, 1:40:14 PM] Jamie: Let’s see how my Spanish does, lol
[2018-11-14, 1:40:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh lucky bastard!
[2018-11-14, 1:40:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha you'll be fine
[2018-11-14, 1:40:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Out of the pan...
[2018-11-14, 1:41:21 PM] Jamie: Yeah I’m sure it will be fine but it’s nerve racking
[2018-11-14, 1:42:24 PM] Rob Feeny: But worth iy
[2018-11-14, 1:42:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Authentic food, practicr
[2018-11-14, 1:42:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Practice
[2018-11-14, 1:43:02 PM] Jamie: Yup. How’s work? Still a gong show
[2018-11-14, 1:43:05 PM] Jamie: ?
[2018-11-14, 1:43:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. Tired and don't want to be here today
[2018-11-14, 1:43:24 PM] Rob Feeny: How's the condo?
[2018-11-14, 3:41:23 PM] Jamie: It’s coming along. Counters went in yesterday and backsplash goes in tomorrow. Then plumber and cleaner on Friday and done. Just got to get it rented
[2018-11-14, 3:41:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Good luck man
[2018-11-14, 3:41:51 PM] Rob Feeny: That'd be a big stress off your mind
[2018-11-14, 3:42:44 PM] Jamie: Yeah it will be
‎[2018-11-17, 12:50:04 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-11-17, 12:50:09 PM] Rob Feeny: That unit looks familiar...
[2018-11-17, 12:51:12 PM] Jamie: Heck ya. That’s my favourite
[2018-11-17, 12:55:52 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm at a Small Housing Summit and it popped up as an example
[2018-11-17, 12:56:20 PM] Jamie: One day I’m going to live in that!
[2018-11-17, 12:56:43 PM] Jamie: But at the rate I’m spending money, I will have nothing left to build one, lol
[2018-11-17, 12:56:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha totally doable

[2018-11-17, 1:04:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha good, those are pretty dated!
[2018-11-17, 1:04:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Love the blue
[2018-11-17, 1:06:33 PM] Jamie: And the countertops are grey quartz, backsplash is same. Much cleaner and seems more modern
[2018-11-17, 1:07:12 PM] Jamie: Thanks! Generally guys hated the blue paint but women loved it. Rented the condo yesterday and the wanted in right away so paid from the 15th
[2018-11-17, 1:09:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man that's awesome I'm glad
‎[2018-11-17, 6:57:52 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-11-17, 6:57:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks familiar too
[2018-11-17, 9:49:07 PM] Jamie: Was it protection island you guys did the install on?
[2018-11-17, 9:59:49 PM] Rob Feeny: No, that was Saturna
[2018-11-17, 10:00:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Just found it in a small housing book

[2018-11-19, 12:47:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome man
[2018-11-19, 12:48:02 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm using Toggl a lot myself lately to try to see where my time goes
[2018-11-19, 1:22:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Café Divano

[2018-11-21, 11:15:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Btw check out Zoho Books, that's what I'm using. If you're still going to operate as a business I can get my data entry guy to do yours at cost ($6 USD per hour)
[2018-11-21, 11:38:25 AM] Jamie: That would be great. It will take me a while to get it running but thanks
‎[2018-11-22, 5:13:14 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2018-11-22, 5:13:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahahha you're a baller now!
[2018-11-22, 5:14:01 PM] Rob Feeny: So crisp!
[2018-11-22, 5:22:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I used to have to withdraw payroll in El salvador all in 5s and 10s. It was nuts. Carrying around a satchel of 5k in small bills
[2018-11-22, 5:23:27 PM] Jamie: That is crazy. I’m nervous about the airport with bundles of cash, lol. In Canada
[2018-11-22, 5:27:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I took down 10K in cash twice
[2018-11-22, 5:27:49 PM] Rob Feeny: inside my shirt in a neck pouch
[2018-11-22, 5:28:07 PM] Jamie: Nice.
[2018-11-22, 5:28:44 PM] Jamie: I still haven’t found a way to port my number and receive texts down there. Still struggling to find a way to use my banks two step verification
[2018-11-22, 5:29:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Ask Morgan what he was using, he's got some data based texting solution for his deadbeat workers
[2018-11-22, 5:32:24 PM] Jamie: If I remember correctly I was going to have to forward it through one service and pay their fees and the fan to the one that he’s using. But the forwarding service doesn’t push text messages from my own mobile number
[2018-11-22, 5:32:34 PM] Jamie: Still working on it
[2018-11-22, 5:49:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok damn
[2018-11-22, 5:49:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe an expat forum?
[2018-11-22, 5:49:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Other people must be having the same problem
[2018-11-22, 6:55:56 PM] Jamie: That’s a good idea. Lots of google voice suggestions but apparently in Canada it doesn’t work
[2018-11-22, 6:56:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Get Dean to register a US number for you? But that's Kludgy
[2018-11-22, 6:57:44 PM] Jamie: Yeah and I want to keep this number. I found one service that gives me a recorded message when people call and allows text to go through but they do not work with short texts like 2 way verification uses. So close
[2018-11-23, 6:30:46 PM] Jamie: How about this lot?

[2018-11-23, 6:46:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow man looks amazing
[2018-11-23, 6:46:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Gabriela would be awesome
[2018-11-23, 6:48:24 PM] Jamie: And it’s super close the the ferry, wonder if I could cut through the forest? I looked at google maps and it’s seems like there is a Building Center, coffee shop, mini mall. And kinda cheap.
[2018-11-23, 6:48:39 PM] Jamie: Feel like taking a trip?
[2018-11-23, 6:49:27 PM] Rob Feeny: I could do it but I'm on Gambier this weekend and then off to Kelowna the following Friday
[2018-11-23, 6:50:32 PM] Jamie: No worries. If it goes it goes. Time isn’t great for me, right as I leave so... keep it in mind if you want a weekend away, subsidized 😉
[2018-11-23, 6:50:38 PM] Rob Feeny: It would be like the 15th
[2018-11-23, 6:51:26 PM] Jamie: It’s low on the priority list for me. If it worked for you cool, but I know it’s a busy time of year
[2018-11-23, 6:56:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, just sent Ben a message, he has a few friends living there, going to see if you can get a local's opinion in the lot
[2018-11-23, 6:56:47 PM] Rob Feeny: On
[2018-11-23, 6:58:00 PM] Jamie: Sweet man. Does he know anything about the zoning? I think it said 1 residence and 3 aux buildings but I wonder if I can just put a THOW on it. If I can get it on the island, lol
[2018-11-23, 6:58:52 PM] Jamie: The only reason I would want it as THOW is for building codes, but I wonder how small I could build there?
[2018-11-23, 6:59:33 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll give him a ring on my way home. I have a few ppl I can ask
[2018-11-23, 7:07:54 PM] Jamie: Thx man
[2018-11-24, 12:12:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok Janice moved early Xmas dinner to Sunday night, that could make it easier to visit Galiano on the 15th/16th
[2018-11-25, 12:04:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey have you talk to a realtor about that Gabriola property yet? The listing is now hidden behind a login
[2018-11-25, 12:20:06 PM] Jamie: I haven’t. Let me check
[2018-11-25, 12:22:25 PM] Jamie: Still there. I do get it directly from a realtor
[2018-11-25, 12:22:28 PM] Jamie: http://app2.interfacexpress.com/mobile-pcs/vancouver_island/PictureViewer;jsessionid=59CE2A3DB965A1B2C15B402F9504BC27.jvm2?picForDisplay=5&mlsForDisplay=448461&listingType=mls&pcsResultVisibility=1&currentSearchID=432200&isPCSMode=true&currentContactID=337095
[2018-11-25, 12:24:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Found it elsewhere, sent it along. I added you to a conversation in messenger
[2018-11-25, 12:25:00 PM] Jamie: Saw that thanks!
[2018-11-25, 12:29:39 PM] Jamie: I guess the goal is to clear as little of the land as possible and drop a very small house. If regulations are tough, THOW but if they are reasonable, just the smallest house possible that I can build for less that about $60,000
[2018-11-25, 3:06:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Talked to Tobi on the phone I'll update you tonight
[2018-11-25, 3:07:03 PM] Jamie: Cool man. Might be drunk. Grey cup with Darren and his family
[2018-11-25, 3:07:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha yup you'll be drunk. Have fun, say Hi for me
[2018-11-26, 10:10:37 PM] Jamie: And my flight is cancelled. So I’m drinking beer at the hotel bar in Calgary instead of flying to Denver, Panama and Ecuador. Lol at least my meal voucher covered the cost of my first beer
[2018-11-26, 10:24:01 PM] Rob Feeny: What happened?
[2018-11-26, 10:24:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Weather?
[2018-11-26, 10:24:25 PM] Rob Feeny: I just spent an hour and 20 min driving to west van in some of the worst weather I've seen yet here
[2018-11-26, 10:48:53 PM] Jamie: Mechanical failure
[2018-11-26, 10:49:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh nice, way better than weather. They have to pay your hotel and compensate you
[2018-11-26, 10:50:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Who are you flying with?
[2018-11-26, 10:51:21 PM] Jamie: United.
[2018-11-26, 10:51:39 PM] Jamie: Is it snowing in Vancouver?
[2018-11-26, 10:53:06 PM] Rob Feeny: No, just raining like the end of the world
[2018-11-26, 10:53:16 PM] Rob Feeny: So much standing water in the roads, it was pretty dicey
[2018-11-26, 10:53:25 PM] Jamie: Crazy
[2018-11-26, 10:53:50 PM] Jamie: Why west van this late
[2018-11-26, 10:53:51 PM] Jamie: ?
[2018-11-26, 10:54:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Tech support for a client. She's useless with computers but pays $85 an hour
[2018-11-26, 10:54:30 PM] Jamie: Nice!
[2018-11-26, 10:55:33 PM] Rob Feeny: But she's behind due to the weather and accident on the bridge so I'm still sitting here waiting to go to her place
[2018-11-26, 10:55:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh well. Got a book to read
[2018-11-26, 10:55:52 PM] Jamie: And on the clock?
[2018-11-26, 10:56:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm doing a 2hr minimum anyway so I'm not worried
[2018-11-26, 10:56:36 PM] Rob Feeny: I have to reinstall her AV software and renew licenses, not hard stuff
[2018-11-26, 11:01:00 PM] Jamie: And make $170. That’s good cash
[2018-11-26, 11:01:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Not unpleasant.
[2018-11-26, 11:01:36 PM] Jamie: I wish I could make that money again, lol.
[2018-11-26, 11:01:39 PM] Rob Feeny: That's about 100 beers in Latin America!
[2018-11-26, 11:01:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Do some remote programming work for Morgan, he's short staffed
[2018-11-26, 11:04:35 PM] Jamie: Haha right? It would go a long way
[2018-11-26, 11:07:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I just want to be at home comfortable and reading my book, but money is money
[2018-11-27, 7:32:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Made it to Ecuador yet?
[2018-11-28, 1:06:04 PM] Jamie: Nope. In Denver drinking coffee at the hotel bar
[2018-11-28, 1:06:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Jesus. Still? Wtf man
[2018-11-28, 1:06:39 PM] Rob Feeny: It's freaking Wednesday
[2018-11-28, 1:06:50 PM] Rob Feeny: They're going to owe you a lot
[2018-11-28, 1:07:00 PM] Jamie: Flight was cancelled and the connecting flight is only every 2 days
[2018-11-28, 1:07:00 PM] Rob Feeny: I hope you're pushing for Max compensation
[2018-11-28, 1:07:18 PM] Jamie: They gave me vouchers for the hotel room and 2 meals.
[2018-11-28, 1:07:37 PM] Jamie: I have kept all my food receipts that were paid without voucher. Should I submit them?
[2018-11-28, 1:07:40 PM] Rob Feeny: If you chirp enough you should get at least $400 in credit, I'd try for more
[2018-11-28, 1:08:06 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd call in and give someone a polite but firm earful
[2018-11-28, 1:08:41 PM] Jamie: Sounds exhausting. They were pretty good considering I turned down the next flight because I would get to Ecuador at 12:30am and my driver couldn’t pick me up
[2018-11-28, 1:09:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Is it $400 worth of exhausting?
[2018-11-28, 1:09:41 PM] Jamie: Probably yup. I have 9 hrs at the airport today till I fly out at 10:20pm so I have time, that’s for sure
[2018-11-28, 1:10:02 PM] Rob Feeny: There may be an online option too
[2018-11-28, 1:10:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Honestly they give out credits rather freely, with work you might get $800. Explain that you didn't want to arrive in a foreign country in the middle of the night with nowhere to stay and no ride
[2018-11-28, 1:11:25 PM] Jamie: I’m going to look at that today. Yesterday I just read at the airport, but I’m going to try to get 4 hrs coding in. Love that I can work anywhere
[2018-11-28, 1:11:36 PM] Jamie: That credit would be handy
[2018-11-28, 1:11:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Alternatively, you could push for a business class upgrade
[2018-11-28, 1:12:24 PM] Jamie: I’m not sure if the next flight is united. I’ll check.
[2018-11-28, 1:12:34 PM] Jamie: Hey did you talk to that guy about Gabriella?
[2018-11-28, 1:13:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. Driving
[2018-11-28, 1:14:24 PM] Jamie: Ok. I’m around all day if you have some time to talk
‎[2018-11-28, 1:15:45 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎audio omitted
[2018-11-28, 1:23:19 PM] Jamie: Hmm the struggle would be to find a contractor that knows the rules regarding tiny house relevant details. Staircases, emergency exits, etc. Not sure if I want to be the test case but I sure am curious
[2018-11-28, 1:24:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I have several designers that know all that. Honestly it would be the perfect situation for prefab
[2018-11-28, 1:24:41 PM] Rob Feeny: If you mean a small home. For tiny houses I have all the info as well
[2018-11-28, 1:29:02 PM] Jamie: It’s scary. If I buy the land and build a $60,000 house I will be broke. With no job
[2018-11-28, 1:29:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Definitely scary, I get it.
[2018-11-28, 1:30:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Buy an RV, bring it to site, do as much of the building as you can yourself?
[2018-11-28, 1:30:07 PM] Jamie: I’m sure I could work part time for cash doing electrical
[2018-11-28, 1:30:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm down for helping
[2018-11-28, 1:34:31 PM] Jamie: Cool. I’m going to start learning Sketch free to model my unit. Haha I really want the roof to slide open above the loft
[2018-11-28, 1:34:52 PM] Jamie: I’m not sure what it’s going to take to pull the trigger.
[2018-11-28, 1:35:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man that would honestly be a nightmare. A lifting skylight like at the solar job could be an option
[2018-11-28, 1:36:43 PM] Jamie: To have floor space on the roof, any solar panels would have to be relocated off the structure. Which might be better. Then it could be added later and might get better sun mounted higher
[2018-11-28, 1:37:32 PM] Jamie: Maybe we can have a video chat soon where I could talk about what I hope to build and you could direct me to something realistic
[2018-11-28, 1:40:28 PM] Rob Feeny: For sure. Busy as hell until the weekend then in Kelowna doing paperwork for a week
[2018-11-28, 1:44:48 PM] Jamie: I should be settled in Ecuador by then
[2018-11-28, 1:52:57 PM] Jamie: It is impossible to eat healthy in the US. Ordered a breakfast burrito with eggs, cheese, pico de galo and I got this, lol
‎[2018-11-28, 1:53:05 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2018-11-28, 1:56:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks tasty... But greasy
[2018-11-28, 1:59:47 PM] Jamie: Yup. But I need the substance for a long day at the airport. Ate the insides and left the grease absorbed into the tortilla
[2018-11-28, 2:02:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice. And yep, it's a challenge. And everyone there stands on the escalator! it kills me
[2018-11-28, 2:10:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a bit of time off and on now, pulling wire
[2018-11-28, 2:11:16 PM] Rob Feeny: A ground mounted solar array is definitely an option, but if you have 3 accessory buildings, it would be good to build something (storage, shop) to put them on the roof for better light exposure. It can be super simple, just strong enough to not let they fly off in a storm
[2018-11-28, 2:15:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Getting approved for anything like a rooftop deck is difficult, it's probably something to plan for and then do unpermitted
[2018-11-28, 2:16:08 PM] Rob Feeny: But skylights, while a pain and expensive, are wonderful
[2018-11-28, 2:16:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Prefab is definitely an option, especially if we could work something out to build it here under someone's certification and then have it CSA certified and trucked to site
[2018-11-28, 2:37:37 PM] Jamie: And barged?
[2018-11-28, 2:43:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes, we'd be able to haul it most of the way on BC ferries
[2018-11-28, 2:44:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Then a barge from Nanaimo
[2018-11-28, 2:44:36 PM] Jamie: I like the idea of prefab. I can be clearing the land while it being built. Less time owning the land without a place to sleep
[2018-11-28, 2:45:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup and it can be cheaper than building on site too
[2018-11-28, 2:45:16 PM] Rob Feeny: And ends up with a better product
[2018-11-28, 2:45:51 PM] Jamie: I think so. So if I put a skylight that opens will they expect me to have railings on the roof?
[2018-11-28, 2:49:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Spec a skylight, don't mention that it opens..
[2018-11-28, 2:49:34 PM] Rob Feeny: If people are going to be on the roof, you'll probably need a full engineer report for $1k
[2018-11-28, 2:49:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Just a roof can be done without one
[2018-11-28, 2:49:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Using a span table for the area
[2018-11-28, 2:50:08 PM] Jamie: What’s a span table?
[2018-11-28, 2:50:37 PM] Rob Feeny: But the unit you shower me has a sloped shed roof, are you hoping to use that space for anything more than laying there with a book?
[2018-11-28, 2:51:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Span table shows what max snow/water /weight load you get from spanning a known gap with different types of lumber
[2018-11-28, 2:51:22 PM] Rob Feeny: So you basically look up the width of your house and see what you need
[2018-11-28, 2:51:55 PM] Jamie: Probably not but I like the idea of a chair up there so I can drink my coffee. A sloped roof will reduce the height in the loft on one side too
[2018-11-28, 2:52:17 PM] Jamie: But sure would hate to have to shovel the roof, ha
[2018-11-28, 2:58:11 PM] Rob Feeny: A flat roof is a lot more work that takes different materials and more money
[2018-11-28, 2:58:33 PM] Rob Feeny: A slight slope is highly recommended, just build a chair on rubber pads to set up there...
[2018-11-28, 2:58:49 PM] Rob Feeny: It doesn't have to be much of a slope at all
[2018-11-28, 2:59:40 PM] Jamie: I could totally cut the legs a little to make it sit flat too
[2018-11-28, 3:19:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Exactly. Simple works. We've done a rooftop deck and it was a pain, plus zoning usually says no because noise up high travels and the risk factor
[2018-11-28, 3:19:42 PM] Rob Feeny: If you put it in the plans, you need a roof strong enough for the snow load plus the weight of people, BBQ, coolers etc.
[2018-11-28, 8:25:27 PM] Rob Feeny: You moved airports yet?
[2018-11-29, 6:44:44 PM] Jamie: Made it to Montañita. You really would love it here I think
[2018-11-29, 6:45:44 PM] Rob Feeny: I intend to visit this coming year
[2018-11-29, 6:45:50 PM] Rob Feeny: How long are you there?
[2018-11-29, 6:47:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Glad you made it
[2018-11-29, 6:47:43 PM] Jamie: Not sure. See what the vibe is like and if I’m making progress on my coding. I think I’ve decided that I want to come back to Vancouver next summer and take the web dev course from Lighthouse labs too. It will help me market and create web apps to supplement the iOS ones
[2018-11-29, 6:48:47 PM] Rob Feeny: By then you'll be itching for some high society again
[2018-11-29, 6:52:57 PM] Jamie: Probably, haha
[2018-11-29, 6:54:02 PM] Rob Feeny: If I keep working like this I'll need to find a place to hole up and work for a few months, but I was thinking of Joyua in El Salvador. There's an amazing hostel way in the mountains, I think we took yoy
[2018-11-29, 6:54:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Less distractions there
[2018-11-29, 6:54:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Hostal Anáhuac
[2018-11-29, 6:54:54 PM] Jamie: Sounds perfect for you!
[2018-11-29, 6:56:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Although I hear Thailand is nice and the food is better
[2018-11-30, 12:18:34 PM] Jamie: Annoying! My pin doesn’t work!  I tired to test it in the US but because it’s a credit card, I didn’t have to enter the pin
[2018-11-30, 12:20:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Seriously? To withdraw cash?
[2018-11-30, 12:25:04 PM] Jamie: No to purchase. In Canada you put s chip in and I thought you always punch in the pin.
[2018-11-30, 12:26:20 PM] Rob Feeny: But you were tapping?
[2018-11-30, 12:26:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Can you request a new one? I can do mine online with Tangerine
[2018-11-30, 12:28:29 PM] Jamie: No tap on the American card
[2018-11-30, 12:29:20 PM] Jamie: I will call them today. I can’t log in (2 step verification to text) but I may be able to work something out. I have all my Canadian cards but it will cost me a fortune.
[2018-11-30, 12:29:52 PM] Jamie: $5 each withdrawal max $300 plus exchange rate to USD at bank rate 😬
[2018-11-30, 12:30:05 PM] Jamie: I’ll figure it out.
[2018-11-30, 12:31:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch
[2018-11-30, 12:56:52 PM] Jamie: I may need to add your number again for 2 way verification
[2018-11-30, 12:58:42 PM] Rob Feeny: No worries
[2018-12-01, 6:55:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey did you know Rick Frizell lives on Gabriola?
[2018-12-01, 7:06:47 PM] Jamie: No I didn’t actually
[2018-12-01, 7:13:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep him and Myles are there now. Maybe I'll pop in when I go there
[2018-12-05, 6:42:37 PM] Rob Feeny: So how are you doing on your time trscking? And what were you using again? Toggl? I'm trying to improve my time tracking
[2018-12-05, 6:43:30 PM] Jamie: Yup Toggl. Works perfect for what I need. The reminders are annoying sometimes but help other times
[2018-12-05, 7:33:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I can't say I have them turned on, but I should do that
[2018-12-05, 7:34:22 PM] Rob Feeny: My time just always seems to evaporate and I want to know how much time I am putting into my fixed price contract jobs
[2018-12-06, 4:29:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Trivia question re: electrical box connectors. The non-metalic ones seem to be 1/2” to fit a 1/2" knockout but the metal/bx ones are 3/8” to fit a 1/2” knockout?
[2018-12-06, 4:29:27 PM] Rob Feeny: That would be the 'standard' (most common) size?
[2018-12-06, 5:52:00 PM] Jamie: 3/8 is the standard size and then 3/4
[2018-12-06, 5:52:44 PM] Jamie: Mostly residential is non metallic and uses the cheapest connector or a built in system to clamp.
[2018-12-06, 5:52:39 PM] Rob Feeny: For the metal box connectors?
[2018-12-06, 5:52:56 PM] Jamie: Commercial uses real connectors that are 3/8”
‎[2018-12-06, 5:53:00 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-12-06, 5:53:09 PM] Rob Feeny: But these guys are 1/2”¿
[2018-12-06, 5:53:12 PM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2018-12-06, 5:54:23 PM] Jamie: It might be advertised to fit 1/2 knockout but the commercial connectors are 3/8 inch to also fit in a 1/2 KO
[2018-12-06, 5:54:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Just trying to sort what Supervans should be carrying (the most common)
[2018-12-06, 5:54:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, just tried one to confirm. Thanks man
[2018-12-06, 5:54:54 PM] Jamie: No prob
[2018-12-06, 5:55:14 PM] Jamie: Those are the cheapest and most common loomex connector that you have there
[2018-12-06, 5:55:42 PM] Rob Feeny: I think we're stocking those and the metal ones that are loomex/bx compatible
[2018-12-06, 5:55:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Not a huge stock of electrical stuff but a few basics
[2018-12-06, 5:56:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Just the 1/2 knockout but 3/8 connector had me confused
[2018-12-06, 5:57:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey I was discussing with Paul, doing a thing where we share our Toggl summary each Sunday to show off how much we have (or haven't) done in the week
[2018-12-06, 5:57:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Thought you might be interested. Just a WhatsApp group
[2018-12-06, 6:05:27 PM] Jamie: Haha my 12 hrs a week isn’t gonna motivate anyone, lol
[2018-12-06, 6:05:44 PM] Jamie: Btw that property sold on Gabriela for $125,000
[2018-12-06, 6:05:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah crap. Sorry to hear it.
[2018-12-06, 6:06:15 PM] Jamie: It’s ok. Timing wasn’t right.
[2018-12-06, 6:06:16 PM] Rob Feeny: And Paul is probably going to come in at 4-6 because he has a full time job
[2018-12-06, 6:07:44 PM] Jamie: I’ll think about it. I’m here sorta trying to balance my life and I’m not sure comparing it to hyper busy Vancouver would help me. But I like the idea, just not sure if it will fit
[2018-12-06, 6:08:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Alright no worries
[2018-12-06, 6:08:27 PM] Jamie: How’s things though?
[2018-12-06, 6:10:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Good man. I'm in Kelowna working but damnit I could use 3 weeks off to work. So much consulting work and project planning
[2018-12-06, 6:11:02 PM] Rob Feeny: How's surfing?
[2018-12-06, 6:12:00 PM] Jamie: It’s good! Just got back from the next little town over. I’m not back to top shape yet but gaining strength each day
[2018-12-06, 6:12:16 PM] Jamie: Running with 2 beautiful young German girls each day too.
[2018-12-06, 6:12:46 PM] Jamie: And still getting a couple hours a day coding. Happy with this pace for the next 3 months
[2018-12-06, 6:14:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha what a hard life for an old man
[2018-12-06, 6:14:44 PM] Jamie: It’s tough but I manage 😎
[2018-12-06, 6:14:58 PM] Jamie: Losing wifi, later dude!
[2018-12-06, 6:16:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Have fun
[2018-12-07, 5:32:23 PM] Jamie: Hey actually maybe I do want to be added to the motivation group. Makes sense and I can see it being hard to stay on track here
[2018-12-07, 5:33:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I have set it up yet but Paul is keen
[2018-12-07, 5:34:02 PM] Rob Feeny: I've done well tracking this week
‎[2018-12-10, 12:01:38 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2018-12-10, 1:56:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, setting that up is on my list for today
‎[2018-12-10, 1:57:27 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2018-12-15, 2:17:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Soooo.... Now that you are an app developer... Is it time to develop "Musi-kkake"?
[2018-12-20, 9:05:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm turning into you 😬

[2018-12-20, 9:05:59 PM] Jamie: Hey the cardboards a good idea. We just used tape
[2018-12-20, 9:06:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I learned the hard way I needed to do more... The leads on these insteon switches let them dangle and bang
[2018-12-20, 9:07:08 PM] Jamie: Yeah. And the aluminum edges leave grey marks and/or scratches
[2018-12-20, 9:07:24 PM] Jamie: Pretty busy these days? I hear you have Morgan working for you
[2018-12-20, 9:07:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha naw just farming out my Mexican to him at times
[2018-12-20, 9:07:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Super super busy
[2018-12-20, 9:07:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Just got back from the island for work
[2018-12-20, 9:07:57 PM] Jamie: Good to hear man.
[2018-12-20, 9:07:58 PM] Rob Feeny: How's surfing?
[2018-12-20, 9:08:38 PM] Jamie: It’s pretty great. I’m getting very strong and seeing major improvement on my on wave maneuvering
[2018-12-20, 9:09:03 PM] Jamie: I may take tomorrow off, my shoulders are doing ok but pretty sore
[2018-12-20, 9:11:30 PM] Jamie: Floating cabin on Upper Peninsula, Michigan
https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyPlaces/comments/a819hd/floating_cabin_on_upper_peninsula_michigan/?st=JPXEF5GG&sh=06a11b0b
[2018-12-20, 9:18:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Damnnnnnn
[2018-12-20, 9:18:19 PM] Rob Feeny: You should log your surfing hours as work in Toggl 👍🏻
[2018-12-20, 9:21:37 PM] Jamie: Haha that’s actually a cool idea. I want to understand how often I surf. If 10,000 hrs makes you an expert...
[2018-12-20, 9:42:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Very true. I'm sure it's building up fast
[2018-12-25, 6:12:02 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob didn’t get to chat but Merry Christmas!
[2018-12-25, 6:31:14 PM] Rob Feeny: You too, Jamie, hope it was a good day
[2018-12-27, 11:43:51 AM] Rob Feeny: How's the surf life?
[2018-12-27, 1:08:58 PM] Jamie: Took the last 2 days off for my shoulder.
[2018-12-27, 1:10:07 PM] Jamie: Definitely still struggle mentally here. Very difficult to get close to anyone so I go through waves of not bothering to invest in new people.
[2018-12-27, 1:52:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I get it. Plus there's a steady flow of people, nothing stays the same?

[2018-12-28, 3:34:45 PM] Rob Feeny: That look crooked to you?
[2018-12-28, 4:01:11 PM] Jamie: Swollen up above the cut. What happened?
[2018-12-28, 4:22:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Locked up a drill, bashed my nose. Was worried I broke it. It was crooked for sure at first
[2018-12-28, 4:23:20 PM] Jamie: Ouch. I smashed my hand against a stud doing that. Broke blood vessels.
[2018-12-28, 4:23:25 PM] Jamie: Good thing you got a hard head
[2018-12-28, 4:34:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Hurt like a mf. Might get it checked out tonight. I don't want to get even uglier
[2018-12-28, 4:35:19 PM] Jamie: It’s character, right? Chick dig scars
[2018-12-28, 4:35:32 PM] Jamie: How is work? Still grunting out the hours?
[2018-12-28, 4:36:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah Tiny House work today

[2018-12-28, 4:38:38 PM] Jamie: Very cool. I’m trying to put some hours in learning sketchup to design one. But I’m sick with a cold !!
[2018-12-28, 4:38:53 PM] Rob Feeny: In the tropics hey? That sucks
[2018-12-29, 2:38:42 PM] Rob Feeny: So how's your head doing today?
[2018-12-29, 3:13:13 PM] Jamie: Well the pressure is gone and I’m in the draining stage. Snot everywhere!
[2018-12-29, 3:13:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha lovely. To add to the sweat
[2018-12-29, 3:22:16 PM] Jamie: How it going there?
[2018-12-29, 3:25:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Decent. Nose is fixed, he just forced it back into place. Cartilage damage only. Just swollen now.
[2018-12-29, 3:25:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Buying ski boots 😬
[2018-12-29, 3:26:06 PM] Jamie: Oh shit. You’re too old to ski, you’ll kill yourself, lol
[2018-12-29, 3:28:17 PM] Rob Feeny: You're too old to surf, you'll kill yourself ;)
[2018-12-29, 7:09:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugh $800 later...
[2018-12-29, 7:55:57 PM] Jamie: For boots?!?!
[2018-12-29, 7:56:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Boots, socks, insoles. Yep.
[2018-12-29, 7:56:38 PM] Rob Feeny: And that was a deal.
[2018-12-29, 8:01:38 PM] Jamie: Did you buy a seasons pass?
[2018-12-29, 8:01:59 PM] Jamie: That’s just a ridiculous amount of money for an occasional sport
[2018-12-29, 8:02:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope, boots for resorts/back country touring
[2018-12-29, 8:02:21 PM] Rob Feeny: A ton of my friends do it. I am trying to get into it.
[2018-12-29, 8:02:35 PM] Jamie: Ahhhh ok well that makes more sense. Rent the skis?
[2018-12-29, 8:02:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Expensive gear but then free after that
[2018-12-29, 8:02:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah exactly
[2018-12-29, 8:03:00 PM] Jamie: No that makes way more sense than downhill ski boots
[2018-12-29, 8:03:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Resort only boots are more like 400
[2018-12-29, 8:03:56 PM] Rob Feeny: I bought some used ones last year but they trashed my feet
[2019-01-02, 3:24:07 PM] Jamie: Find something to do other than party for New Years?
[2019-01-02, 3:25:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, played games at a friend's office in gastown and then watched the fireworks from their fire escape
[2019-01-02, 3:25:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Then went snowshoeing up a mountain today
[2019-01-02, 3:25:57 PM] Rob Feeny: How was the moonlight surfing?
[2019-01-02, 3:28:28 PM] Jamie: It was freaking awesome. Hard to explain the calm out there while watching the zoo. It’s like the eye of the storm.
[2019-01-02, 3:30:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I bet! And you stayed sober as well?
[2019-01-02, 3:35:00 PM] Jamie: Totally. Not even a beer
[2019-01-02, 3:35:48 PM] Jamie: I barely drink alcohol here. Don’t smoke weed either. It is not the normal, ha
[2019-01-02, 3:51:26 PM] Rob Feeny: That's great. Sounds super healthy. They actually just posted a thing about Yoga Teacher Training in Ecuador at the studio in Puerto Lopez and if I had about 4k to spare I'd do it
[2019-01-02, 3:53:51 PM] Jamie: Oh very cool
[2019-01-02, 4:01:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm yep 3k plus flight, one month of training
[2019-01-02, 4:13:27 PM] Jamie: You thinking about doing yoga training?
[2019-01-02, 4:14:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahah no, just thinking about spending a month doing yoga in a tropical country...
[2019-01-02, 4:14:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Dreams for if I were wealthy
‎[2019-01-06, 1:04:22 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-06, 1:08:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I need to duplicate some shifts that are in Tsheets not Toggl them I'll send it along. Nice work. A while ago weren't you saying you wanted to do 12 and now you're doing 20...
[2019-01-06, 1:26:43 PM] Jamie: I would like to be 4 x 6 days a week
[2019-01-06, 1:28:20 PM] Rob Feeny: 4 hrs a day, 6 days a week?
[2019-01-06, 1:28:34 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-01-06, 1:31:58 PM] Rob Feeny: That works
[2019-01-06, 1:35:32 PM] Jamie: How’s your Sunday?
[2019-01-06, 1:37:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Super chill so far. Yoga and shopping
[2019-01-06, 1:38:05 PM] Jamie: Not so bad. Raining here so pretty slack day. Might surf but not sure
[2019-01-06, 1:38:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Sounds great. I need to take a day soon a recoup
[2019-01-06, 1:38:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Is it rainy season?
[2019-01-06, 1:39:05 PM] Jamie: Nope. Just a random rainy day
[2019-01-06, 1:41:18 PM] Rob Feeny: And what does a rainy day in Montañita look like?
[2019-01-06, 1:52:44 PM] Jamie: A very slow walk to get my laundry because flip flops and mud
[2019-01-06, 1:53:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha when is the last time you out real shoes on?
[2019-01-06, 1:53:21 PM] Jamie: Flip flops are real shoes!
[2019-01-06, 1:53:29 PM] Jamie: Real comfy 😉
[2019-01-06, 1:56:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha
[2019-01-06, 1:57:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I wish I could do flip-flops every day
‎[2019-01-06, 10:56:09 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-06, 10:56:48 PM] Rob Feeny: 32.5hrs all told. Not bad for 4 days of work
[2019-01-06, 10:57:04 PM] Jamie: Not bad at all. How much paid work?
[2019-01-06, 10:57:33 PM] Rob Feeny: All but 6.25hrs
[2019-01-06, 10:57:42 PM] Rob Feeny: This coming week should be good too
[2019-01-10, 10:23:03 AM] Jamie: And my computer died... annoying.
[2019-01-10, 10:27:34 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh damn! That sucks!
[2019-01-10, 10:30:55 AM] Jamie: Really does. I can’t be here if I’m not working
[2019-01-10, 10:33:08 AM] Rob Feeny: And all repairs/replacements are in Guayaquil?
[2019-01-10, 10:35:05 AM] Jamie: Maybe. I couldn’t get it fixed last time until Costa Rica
[2019-01-10, 11:09:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Is the same problem again?
[2019-01-10, 11:10:32 AM] Jamie: Nope. Beeping when off and connected to power. Failed start up test for RAM. If I could take it apart, maybe I could reseat the RAM but no tools for that here.  Should have bought a kit
[2019-01-10, 11:15:06 AM] Rob Feeny: And isn't the ram soldered onto the newer Macs?
[2019-01-10, 11:16:31 AM] Jamie: In the mid 2014, I think you might be right.
[2019-01-10, 11:51:05 AM] Jamie: Ok found a recommended repair place the next town over. Just dropped it off. Hopefully he can fix it 🤞
[2019-01-10, 11:52:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Good luck...
[2019-01-10, 3:22:56 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob. If you have some time can you help me with checking prices on flights? Doing it from my phone is killing me
[2019-01-10, 3:23:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure, where are you flying?
[2019-01-10, 3:23:44 PM] Jamie: I think it might even be cheaper to use my original ticket to Calgary, fix my computer there and then fly to Mexico return from either Calgary, Kelowna or Vancouver.
[2019-01-10, 3:23:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't have WiFi here for my laptop but probably this evening, 8ish. What time is that for you?
[2019-01-10, 3:23:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh wow
[2019-01-10, 3:24:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I just booked 2 weeks in El Salvador last night 👍🏻
[2019-01-10, 3:24:20 PM] Jamie: It’s 11pm but it doesn’t have to be today. In the next few days...
[2019-01-10, 3:24:25 PM] Jamie: Crazy. When?
[2019-01-10, 3:28:18 PM] Jamie: So I’m looking for flights from Ecuador (Guayaquil) to Puerto Vallarta just before Feb 26th (last day I can be in Ecuador) then back to Vancouver or Kelowna < 90 days later... or .... use my ticket to Calgary on Feb 23 and 2 weeks later fly to Puerto Vallarta returning < 90 days later.
[2019-01-10, 3:28:32 PM] Jamie: Pretty complicated on the phone, lol
[2019-01-10, 3:29:20 PM] Jamie: And I could fly out of Calgary, Kelowna or Vancouver to Puerto Vallarta
[2019-01-10, 3:29:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha complicated indeed!
[2019-01-10, 3:29:37 PM] Rob Feeny: And I'm going Feb 20 to March 6th
[2019-01-10, 3:31:47 PM] Jamie: Ah ok
[2019-01-10, 3:32:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Heading to Sayulita or somewhere there?
[2019-01-10, 3:34:03 PM] Jamie: Punta de Mita (close to Sayulita) then down to Puerto Escondido
[2019-01-10, 3:35:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh I know Punta de Mita. I also have a friend in Puerto Escondido if you need someone to show you around
[2019-01-10, 3:35:46 PM] Jamie: That would be great!  Have to figure out where to stay, it’s a pretty big place compared to here
[2019-01-10, 3:36:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Indeed. Last time I was there there was an amazingly well run Hostel, run by a German lady called the Mayflower
[2019-01-10, 3:36:43 PM] Rob Feeny: But Almendra would know the best spot
[2019-01-10, 3:37:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Those are some serious waves down there man
[2019-01-10, 3:37:30 PM] Jamie: I know! Excited!
[2019-01-10, 3:37:48 PM] Jamie: I forgot you went there. Isn’t there a sandbar with your face imprinted on it? 😉
[2019-01-10, 3:38:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha in San Pancho, North of Sayulita there is. I definitely left some skin on that beach
[2019-01-10, 3:38:58 PM] Jamie: Ahh someone else suggest San Pancho. Did you do PE and Sayulita same trip?
[2019-01-10, 3:39:32 PM] Rob Feeny: No, I just hung out in San Pancho and daytripped to Sayulita. I haven't been to PE in maybe 8 years?
[2019-01-10, 3:39:38 PM] Rob Feeny: I've been there twice
[2019-01-10, 3:40:21 PM] Rob Feeny: San Pancho is way more chill than Sayulita. I much preferred it
[2019-01-10, 3:40:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Actually my friend Happy should be in San Pancho around then I think
[2019-01-10, 3:40:54 PM] Jamie: I heard so many bad things about Sayulita actually
[2019-01-10, 3:41:06 PM] Jamie: So I was going to avoid it.
[2019-01-10, 3:41:25 PM] Jamie: I’m heading out surfing, thanks for the info! Later dude
[2019-01-10, 3:41:30 PM] Rob Feeny: It's great if you're not into the real Mexico and it has bars and shops. It's beautiful just not my scene. Too big.
[2019-01-10, 3:41:32 PM] Rob Feeny: See ya man
[2019-01-11, 11:57:44 AM] Jamie: Looks like I can’t get it fixed locally. Maybe the RAM needs to be resoldered
[2019-01-13, 10:34:57 AM] Rob Feeny: https://vancouver.craigslist.org/nvn/for/d/north-vancouver-hidden-tiny-home-trades/6778867984.html
[2019-01-13, 10:35:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Just killing time before yoga, got some time to sort your flights after, what's your day like?
[2019-01-13, 10:36:04 AM] Rob Feeny: And I've been looking at trucks like that, truck only, for 8k. That has the truck and about 10k worth of parts....
[2019-01-13, 10:36:45 AM] Rob Feeny: I'd lose the box and build on the frame but just the RV furnace is work 1200, the hot water heater is another k, the propane tank etc are damn expensive
[2019-01-13, 10:53:27 AM] Jamie: Hey man
[2019-01-13, 10:53:35 AM] Jamie: Just got back from a run. I’m open
[2019-01-13, 2:57:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry got distracted having breakfast with Dan after yoga
[2019-01-13, 2:57:17 PM] Rob Feeny: You around? I'm at home for the next 3-4 hrs
[2019-01-13, 3:01:07 PM] Jamie: Yup I’m around. Video chat?
[2019-01-13, 3:01:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure gimme a few min, fave song is on the radio, got it cranked!

[2019-01-14, 2:59:06 PM] Jamie: Hmm doesn’t look good for repairs. FixMyTouch seemed to think they could not repair and Apple support mentioned that they probably have to send it away, if possible to fix
[2019-01-14, 3:05:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn not good
[2019-01-14, 3:07:15 PM] Jamie: Yeah. The idea of paying $3k plus buying all new adapters is not exciting although I want the new computer.
[2019-01-14, 3:07:19 PM] Jamie: Maybe a used one
[2019-01-14, 3:12:47 PM] Rob Feeny: That's what I usually do
[2019-01-14, 3:12:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Get something off Craigslist for half the price
[2019-01-14, 3:13:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe leave your current one getting repaired
[2019-01-14, 3:13:24 PM] Jamie: Yeah wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, apparently, lol
[2019-01-14, 3:19:08 PM] Rob Feeny: If needed I could hang onto it and DHL it to you if needed
[2019-01-14, 3:19:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I've got a commercial DHL account
[2019-01-14, 3:20:41 PM] Jamie: Wow. From no decisions to so many, lol. I’m out of practice.
[2019-01-14, 3:21:17 PM] Jamie: But that could work. I have read DHL is fine for PE
[2019-01-14, 3:21:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha what a hard life
‎[2019-01-14, 7:53:17 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-14, 7:53:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Quite the truck
[2019-01-14, 9:40:57 PM] Jamie: Jesus. You gonna buy it?
[2019-01-14, 9:45:03 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm going to do some research. The freaking thing is 37ft long
‎[2019-01-14, 9:45:23 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-14, 9:45:45 PM] Jamie: Haha that’s the size of the truck I drove in Calgary for VanTran Logistics. A beast
[2019-01-14, 9:45:51 PM] Jamie: Any inside pics?
[2019-01-14, 9:45:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Seems to be in incredible shape and he's throwing in about $6k-7k of parts

‎[2019-01-14, 9:46:23 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-14, 9:46:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I wouldn't use the box. I'd probably use it as a shop then sell it.
[2019-01-14, 9:47:55 PM] Jamie: Why is he selling it?
[2019-01-14, 9:48:35 PM] Rob Feeny: He's on disability now, loads of health problems. It's stored at his parents house and they're selling and moving into a home
[2019-01-14, 9:48:42 PM] Rob Feeny: He hasn't worked on it in 6 months
[2019-01-14, 9:48:51 PM] Jamie: Ahh shitty deal for him
[2019-01-14, 9:48:58 PM] Rob Feeny: After talking with him, he doesn't seem like he had the skills to do it
[2019-01-14, 9:49:24 PM] Rob Feeny: And sadly didn't have the energy to brute force it like most people without the skill set do
[2019-01-14, 9:49:41 PM] Rob Feeny: It comes with all the plumbing and electrical I could use.
[2019-01-14, 9:50:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Furnace, water heater, water pump, tanks, the truck already has a huge auxiliary propane tank
[2019-01-14, 9:50:37 PM] Jamie: Wow. Where would you store it?
[2019-01-14, 9:50:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a couple options, a place in Squamish and another in Maple Ridge
[2019-01-14, 9:51:05 PM] Rob Feeny: It would definitely be a multi year project
[2019-01-14, 9:51:26 PM] Jamie: I bet. But fun.  Diesel?
[2019-01-14, 9:51:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. 5.9l inline 6
[2019-01-14, 9:51:54 PM] Rob Feeny: The interior is ok, not great
[2019-01-14, 9:52:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Gotta drive home now
[2019-01-14, 9:52:42 PM] Jamie: Ok later
[2019-01-14, 9:54:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to do just a WhatsApp call?
[2019-01-14, 9:54:49 PM] Jamie: I’m pretty beat. Did you need to talk or was it for booking the flight?
[2019-01-14, 9:55:07 PM] Rob Feeny: No I just cuz I'm driving home and have nothing to do
[2019-01-14, 9:55:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Get some rest
[2019-01-15, 8:43:15 AM] Rob Feeny: Walk around it
‎[2019-01-15, 8:44:20 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎video omitted
[2019-01-15, 3:34:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Truck inspection scheduled for tomorrow
[2019-01-15, 3:36:07 PM] Jamie: Oh shit. You’re serious about buying this
[2019-01-15, 3:36:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep.
[2019-01-15, 3:43:45 PM] Jamie: Cool man
[2019-01-15, 3:44:04 PM] Rob Feeny: You only live once, right? 😬
[2019-01-15, 3:44:17 PM] Jamie: Haha it will be cool
[2019-01-16, 3:28:33 PM] Jamie: How much to insure this bad boy?
[2019-01-16, 4:03:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Like 2k a year...
[2019-01-16, 4:03:04 PM] Rob Feeny: !
[2019-01-16, 4:03:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Just dropped it at the shop. Holy eff it's a big beast
[2019-01-16, 4:05:11 PM] Jamie: Yes it is. You drive it?
[2019-01-16, 4:05:18 PM] Jamie: Standard or auto?
[2019-01-16, 4:05:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, I drive it. 6spd standard
[2019-01-16, 4:06:50 PM] Jamie: Nice.
[2019-01-16, 4:07:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm the place is Ucluelet us right on the highway huh? I would personally consider that a drawback...
[2019-01-16, 4:07:59 PM] Jamie: Unless somehow we have a business below either operating or rented out. Be nice to have a home that pays for itself
[2019-01-16, 4:08:20 PM] Jamie: Balcony on the back that faces the forest might be nice
[2019-01-16, 4:08:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Very true. And it's not exactly a crazy busy highway
[2019-01-16, 4:08:58 PM] Jamie: Major cost to build and outfit. Maybe a weed store, lol
[2019-01-16, 4:09:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha the market is probably saturated there, all the stoners are there!
[2019-01-16, 4:10:25 PM] Jamie: Totally true. I’m stuck on the idea of somehow having an expense neutral home in Canada.
[2019-01-16, 4:11:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Makes sense
[2019-01-16, 4:15:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha man. The anxiety.
[2019-01-16, 4:16:13 PM] Jamie: Spending 8k?
[2019-01-16, 4:18:09 PM] Rob Feeny: The nice part is knowing that if I need to, I can get a few grand for scrap for the truck, plus sell the parts and only lose on on time and maybe 2i
[2019-01-16, 4:29:24 PM] Jamie: I’m sure the truck has value to someone
[2019-01-16, 4:31:02 PM] Rob Feeny: For sure, it's why I'm probably going to do it, it's a risk worth taking
[2019-01-16, 7:00:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Oooooh shit man. I think I just bought a truck 😬
‎[2019-01-16, 7:01:32 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-16, 7:04:42 PM] Jamie: Crazy!  Haha where the hell will you out in tonight? Hopefully he can store it for a bit
[2019-01-16, 7:05:06 PM] Rob Feeny: I can store it there for the next 2 months
[2019-01-16, 7:10:31 PM] Jamie: That’s good. Well sounds like a fun adventure man
[2019-01-16, 7:12:30 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm slightly shiting bricks here but honestly if I get cold feet in a monthI'm pretty sure I can turn it around and make money on it
[2019-01-17, 10:44:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Hehe. I'm going to call it the Fortuga
[2019-01-19, 1:57:24 PM] Jamie: Hey man for what it’s worth, I have total faith that this truck will turn into something awesome. Maybe to others it seems like an impulse purchase, but I know better. I’m excited for you
[2019-01-19, 1:57:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks Jamie. Dad was dubious... Just a lot of "hmmmm"s
[2019-01-19, 1:59:03 PM] Jamie: Yeah well Dads from a different generation.  I’m sure his parent didn’t understand him going up North to teach the indigenous people
[2019-01-19, 2:00:20 PM] Rob Feeny: True. He leads a pretty safe life
[2019-01-19, 2:01:06 PM] Jamie: I think it kills him that I am spending so much money each month with no income, haha
[2019-01-19, 3:53:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha yep. Us no good hippy beatniks
[2019-01-19, 3:54:08 PM] Rob Feeny: I think the last 3 years has taught me a lot about happiness and expectations
[2019-01-19, 3:54:41 PM] Rob Feeny: They're both within my control. They have also taught me that I'll always be able to support myself, even if I don't have a 'job'
[2019-01-20, 9:09:51 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll have to update Toggl when I get back from skiing and send my summary, it was a huge week for work, loads of hours put in
[2019-01-20, 9:10:44 AM] Jamie: Yeah not many hours on this side. 2.5 hrs Spanish 5 days this week
[2019-01-20, 9:10:57 AM] Rob Feeny: Per day or total?
[2019-01-20, 9:11:07 AM] Jamie: Per day
[2019-01-20, 9:11:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice, that's not insignificant
[2019-01-20, 9:34:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok just did one of the craziest outdoor activities I've ever done
[2019-01-20, 9:41:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Climbed that mountain with ice axe and crampons after skiing to near the top

[2019-01-21, 4:47:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I wouldn't have been able to do it in the old ones

[2019-01-22, 2:04:11 PM] Rob Feeny: A very productive week, but it's scary that only 12hrs were billable
[2019-01-22, 2:05:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Ricardo made me a few hundred but then I burned that up paying him to work with me on the house truck on Friday
[2019-01-22, 7:08:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm curious what Morgan's been getting up to because right now he owes me ten grand
[2019-01-22, 7:09:01 PM] Rob Feeny: That's pretty unusual.
[2019-01-22, 7:14:12 PM] Jamie: Maybe packing?
[2019-01-22, 7:15:43 PM] Rob Feeny: I know he's waiting on Rob for a bunch of money but he has some stuff that's a month-and-a-half old
[2019-01-22, 7:16:05 PM] Rob Feeny: It's just unusual because he usually pays in 48 hours
[2019-01-22, 7:18:14 PM] Jamie: Probably a tight month paying the deposit on the new place, probably bought a bunch of new furniture and he has to pay for his sugar baby too. Mans got bills!
[2019-01-22, 7:18:20 PM] Jamie: Did you ask him for it?
[2019-01-22, 7:18:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Sugar babies...
[2019-01-22, 7:18:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Hi yeah I did a bit ago
[2019-01-22, 7:19:05 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm not hurting for cash it's just surprising
[2019-01-22, 7:19:18 PM] Jamie: I think we have been waiting for him to collapse for years but he keeps going, lol
[2019-01-22, 7:23:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha very true
[2019-01-22, 7:23:54 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't expect him to collapse but I'm curious what's going on
‎[2019-01-23, 3:03:40 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-23, 3:03:46 PM] Rob Feeny: $3 thrift store find hehe
[2019-01-23, 3:04:39 PM] Jamie: Looks familiar!
[2019-01-23, 3:05:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Way better than the horrible Blue LED one I had
[2019-01-25, 2:25:00 PM] Jamie: https://www.ecuadorcoastproperties.com/properties-3/asset%3Ds1538712612453
[2019-01-25, 2:27:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn
[2019-01-25, 2:27:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Tempting eh?
[2019-01-25, 2:27:52 PM] Jamie: Yeah. I would be broke though. Flat ass broke
[2019-01-25, 2:28:13 PM] Jamie: Maybe I could get some rent in the high season
[2019-01-25, 2:28:45 PM] Rob Feeny: But no mortgage...
[2019-01-25, 2:29:13 PM] Jamie: Yes but no money to live off of either
[2019-01-25, 2:32:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Might have to get a job like the rest of us slobs!
[2019-01-25, 2:33:04 PM] Rob Feeny: The sheer volume of the shit I got with this truck blows my mind
[2019-01-25, 2:33:15 PM] Jamie: Sorting through it?
[2019-01-25, 2:33:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah we just went through the truck and took out everything that was his
[2019-01-25, 2:33:50 PM] Rob Feeny: I swear I have enough electrical stuff to build three trucks
[2019-01-25, 2:34:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Tools and so much more
[2019-01-25, 2:34:21 PM] Jamie: Cool. And now you have a storage container for all your shit!
[2019-01-25, 2:36:06 PM] Rob Feeny: That's exactly it. I can even get stuff out of my shed!
[2019-01-25, 2:38:48 PM] Rob Feeny: He even threw in a compressor and 3 brad nailers, complete with hoses
[2019-01-25, 2:38:54 PM] Jamie: Jesus
[2019-01-25, 2:46:07 PM] Rob Feeny: So do you think you could find another person to split that house with you?
[2019-01-25, 2:49:45 PM] Jamie: Maybe. Cousin Myles is probably tapped for a bit after the build but he’s my first thought. He’s done a lot of growing up in the last while
[2019-01-25, 2:54:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Much like Kvarno, I can contribute much capital but I could contribute cash flow...
[2019-01-25, 2:54:38 PM] Rob Feeny: $500 a month to give you income or something
[2019-01-25, 2:57:27 PM] Jamie: Hmm I will keep that in mind. Might actual be feasible. USD? Lol
[2019-01-25, 2:57:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Probably still doable
[2019-01-25, 2:57:59 PM] Rob Feeny: It would force me to slack off less haha
[2019-01-25, 2:58:52 PM] Rob Feeny: It's really only 2 solid days of work a month

[2019-01-29, 9:47:37 AM] Rob Feeny: I billed a whole 3.25hrs last week. Not cool!
[2019-01-29, 9:48:05 AM] Rob Feeny: But I ran my ass off all week, getting my house ready for Dean & Curtis and working on that truck
[2019-01-29, 10:01:30 AM] Jamie: Nice man. Have to have some things for your personal self too
[2019-01-29, 10:02:15 AM] Rob Feeny: True. Those are hard to track though. But my home is much nicer lol
[2019-01-29, 10:02:25 AM] Jamie: I haven’t been tracking anything. So sick of being on my phone for everything. Reading, Spanish, Corp taxes, talking to real estate agents etc.

[2019-01-29, 10:02:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Good reason to disconnect though
[2019-01-29, 10:03:19 AM] Jamie: Yeah true. But I’m really excited to be able to work again
[2019-01-29, 10:03:24 AM] Jamie: Did you put flooring in?
[2019-01-29, 10:04:01 AM] Rob Feeny: No just painted the concrete. Those are samples of the flooring I got free with the truck
[2019-01-29, 10:04:07 AM] Jamie: Ahhh
[2019-01-29, 10:04:09 AM] Rob Feeny: But I didn't want wood grain,
[2019-01-29, 10:04:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Because I want the kitchen to be the same and then I've have two different wood grains meeting uo
[2019-01-29, 10:04:45 AM] Jamie: Bare concrete looks good. It’s that yellow linoleum that’s killin the vibe, lol
[2019-01-29, 10:04:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Might do it anyway and just get something else for the kitchen, because those stuff is free
[2019-01-29, 10:05:10 AM] Jamie: Totally.
‎[2019-01-29, 10:05:13 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-29, 10:05:22 AM] Rob Feeny: That truck just keeps giving. Got this free too
[2019-01-29, 10:05:30 AM] Jamie: Fancy! For the fan in the bathroom?
‎[2019-01-29, 10:05:42 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-29, 10:05:43 AM] Rob Feeny: This too
[2019-01-29, 10:05:49 AM] Rob Feeny: Both are $30+
[2019-01-29, 10:05:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep, bathroom
[2019-01-29, 10:07:01 AM] Jamie: Nice. I’m sure you have a spreadsheet for tracking that you are getting your money worth, lol
[2019-01-29, 10:07:33 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha that's the plan eventually. Haven't really sorted anything, just finished the roof sealing, trying to source a steel double door today
[2019-01-29, 10:10:33 AM] Jamie: Ocean trailers I think the name was of this company that bought wrecked trailers, fixed them up and resold them. Was about 20 years since I was in the trucking industry though. Also maybe Jason Robinson May have contacts
[2019-01-29, 10:11:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh that was where he was having the work done on his container?
[2019-01-29, 10:11:39 AM] Jamie: Nope. That’s where we got trailers fixed when I worked for kings logistics in Vancouver
[2019-01-29, 10:12:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok ok. I'll look it up. I've also found a 5ft by 6ft roll up door for cheap on CL but I'd prefer the standard security door style
[2019-01-29, 10:12:45 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm having fun planning the shop part because I have so much salvage gear to use on it
[2019-01-29, 10:12:59 AM] Jamie: Nice!
[2019-01-29, 10:13:00 AM] Rob Feeny: That charger you gave me is going into it
‎[2019-01-29, 10:13:42 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-29, 10:13:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Damn man
[2019-01-29, 10:13:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Lucky
[2019-01-29, 10:14:33 AM] Rob Feeny: Where is she from?
[2019-01-29, 10:16:08 AM] Jamie: Holland. 18 and very determined to get what she wants
[2019-01-29, 10:16:27 AM] Jamie: But totally immature and a little obsessive
[2019-01-29, 10:16:57 AM] Jamie: She got my number from someone else, haha
[2019-01-29, 10:18:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha so you're going to wait until the last minute to sleep with her? Just before she leaves?
[2019-01-29, 10:18:55 AM] Jamie: Yup! Ok gotta go, she’s here. Later
[2019-01-29, 10:19:28 AM] Rob Feeny: Have fun....
[2019-01-29, 12:32:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Got an electrical question for you, you around?
[2019-01-29, 12:32:59 PM] Jamie: Yup.
[2019-01-29, 12:34:36 PM] Rob Feeny: We have a bathroom fan, LED light and vanity light w/ dimmer on a GFCI breaker. It pops instantly anytime we try to turn anything on that circuit on
[2019-01-29, 12:35:17 PM] Jamie: Bypass the gfi breaker and see what happens
[2019-01-29, 12:35:17 PM] Rob Feeny: There's no short we can find (it passed the hi-pot test)
[2019-01-29, 12:35:29 PM] Rob Feeny: With a standard breaker it works fine
[2019-01-29, 12:35:38 PM] Rob Feeny: The fan seems really slow to start
[2019-01-29, 12:36:03 PM] Jamie: Is the fan running when you turn the breaker on? Turn Everything off then turn the breaker on and turn things on one by one
[2019-01-29, 12:36:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll add that the entire unit is being powered by a 15a extension cord at the moment
[2019-01-29, 12:36:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Could that be causing a grounding problem?
[2019-01-29, 12:36:46 PM] Jamie: Test the voltage at the end of the extension cord (panel)
[2019-01-29, 12:37:02 PM] Jamie: If you have volt drop, amps go up.
[2019-01-29, 12:48:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Extension has 120V, I'll check amps
[2019-01-29, 12:52:20 PM] Jamie: Do you have another GFI breaker?
[2019-01-29, 12:53:08 PM] Jamie: Also check continuity between all wires in the circuit. Even with the pot test
‎[2019-01-29, 12:55:51 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-29, 12:56:29 PM] Rob Feeny: So to make this unit 120v only, he's capped off one phase of the incoming power. Could that be causing a problem?
[2019-01-29, 12:56:37 PM] Rob Feeny: I didn't think it would.
[2019-01-29, 12:56:54 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll do continuity now
[2019-01-29, 12:58:21 PM] Rob Feeny: NVM, that capped at both ends
[2019-01-29, 1:00:22 PM] Jamie: Yeah not a problem
[2019-01-29, 1:01:11 PM] Jamie: Try the gfi breaker on another circuit too
[2019-01-29, 1:01:23 PM] Jamie: That should tell you if it is the breaker
[2019-01-29, 1:02:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Blows right away
[2019-01-29, 1:02:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Must be the breaker
[2019-01-29, 1:02:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man, greatly appreciated
[2019-01-29, 1:03:07 PM] Jamie: No worries. I kinda want to help work on these houses with you
[2019-01-29, 1:04:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Anytime man. It's great to learn, probably different problems than the luxury market
[2019-01-29, 1:12:10 PM] Jamie: If I were to come to Vancouver for 3 months, think I could pick up some cash work helping out?
[2019-01-29, 1:12:32 PM] Jamie: Wouldn’t be until probably next year but I like the idea
[2019-01-29, 1:13:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Tim here tends to do his own electrical, but I bet he'd take the help. Ben is contracting out his builds to Tim and another guy now
[2019-01-29, 1:13:49 PM] Rob Feeny: But with some advance warning I'm sure we could line something up
[2019-01-29, 1:14:02 PM] Jamie: Cool just an idea.
[2019-01-29, 1:14:23 PM] Jamie: Not making much progress looking st places here, lol. Tranquillo. x100
[2019-01-29, 1:22:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha hard to do on a phone...
[2019-01-29, 1:26:23 PM] Jamie: Yeah WhatsApp is good for Spanish but getting an answer every 48 hrs is hilarious
[2019-01-29, 1:33:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yup, different lifestyle
[2019-01-29, 1:33:27 PM] Rob Feeny: They probably don't type a lot, just use voice messages
[2019-01-29, 2:02:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Tim sounded open to the idea of having you wire things up when you're here
[2019-01-29, 2:02:09 PM] Rob Feeny: This one has a split AC/DC system
[2019-01-29, 2:02:58 PM] Jamie: Awesome. I just like the idea of learning more about it and I do enjoy construction, smaller scale anyway
[2019-01-29, 2:03:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Exactly. You're stuck helping me with the house truck already
‎[2019-01-29, 2:09:18 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-29, 2:10:13 PM] Jamie: Is that an inverter?
[2019-01-29, 2:10:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Converter / battery charger
[2019-01-29, 2:11:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Plus DC panel. It's an RV load center
[2019-01-29, 2:11:42 PM] Rob Feeny: DC to run the DC electrical system (LED lights, RV furnace, RV range, propane detectors)
[2019-01-29, 2:13:15 PM] Jamie: Cool. I would love to see how they do it
[2019-01-29, 2:29:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Played with DC LED dimmers before?
[2019-01-29, 2:29:43 PM] Rob Feeny: My research says it should be varying amperage, but instead the voltage seems to go from 13.5 to 11 but the lights don't dim
[2019-01-29, 2:30:37 PM] Jamie: All dc? As in 12v in?
‎[2019-01-29, 2:30:46 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-29, 2:30:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2019-01-29, 2:32:38 PM] Jamie: Not really, actually. Normally using a DC dimmer / switch means your transformer is working even when the light is on so we never touch it. The transformer would die quickly
[2019-01-29, 2:32:45 PM] Rob Feeny: The signal is garbage here. Is that a chicken?
[2019-01-29, 2:33:04 PM] Jamie: But in this case, I’m sure the inverter handles that I
[2019-01-29, 2:33:16 PM] Jamie: Yup. Rooster actually
[2019-01-29, 2:33:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha regal beast
[2019-01-29, 2:33:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, where as we don't have a transformer
[2019-01-29, 2:33:37 PM] Jamie: Yeah he’s 18” away from me begging for corn
[2019-01-29, 2:33:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Exactly
[2019-01-29, 2:33:55 PM] Rob Feeny: But the lights don't dim
[2019-01-29, 2:33:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Gallo!
[2019-01-29, 2:33:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Is he visiting the café? Staking his claim?
‎[2019-01-29, 2:33:57 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-29, 2:39:11 PM] Jamie: Are the LEDs dimmable?
[2019-01-29, 2:39:22 PM] Jamie: I google this and seems pretty simple
[2019-01-29, 2:39:49 PM] Jamie: And the owner of the hostel feeds them. Whole family with kids. The chickens I mean
‎[2019-01-29, 2:39:54 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-29, 2:44:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes they are
[2019-01-29, 2:45:29 PM] Rob Feeny: But I can't seem to figure out if the amperage or voltage should be changing. The voltage is changing from the dimmer but it's not affecting the lights.
[2019-01-29, 2:45:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Shame too, these are the lights I want to use in my unit
[2019-01-29, 2:45:48 PM] Jamie: Pretty sure it’s the voltage adjusting.
[2019-01-29, 2:46:07 PM] Jamie: That is supposed to happen
[2019-01-29, 2:46:47 PM] Jamie: Do you have specs on the LEDs?
[2019-01-29, 2:46:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Simple, clean looking and inexpensive
[2019-01-29, 2:48:00 PM] Rob Feeny: No, just the Amazon listing
[2019-01-29, 2:48:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Looking for packaging now

‎[2019-01-29, 2:49:09 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-01-29, 2:49:31 PM] Jamie: Ok my research says it’s the current that gets reduced because most LEDs won’t operate below 7v
[2019-01-29, 2:49:44 PM] Rob Feeny: That's what I had read
[2019-01-29, 2:50:00 PM] Rob Feeny: That DC LED dimmers were different from normal dimmers
[2019-01-29, 2:53:04 PM] Jamie: Can you send me the amazon link? I found the. But they say there is a switch on each light and will not work with external controls
[2019-01-29, 2:53:29 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm also now learning about 0-10v dimmers, the voltage range was 13v to 11v off the dimmer
[2019-01-29, 2:53:59 PM] Jamie: 0-10v dimming is a specific protocol that has to be built in the driver
[2019-01-29, 2:54:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Just trying to load the amazon link to share it
[2019-01-29, 2:55:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Dream Lighting 4.5" Warm White Cabin Lighting Fixture - 3.8W LED Ceiling Light Pack of 6 https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00ODSAZNC/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_i_29kuCb91C0N7X
[2019-01-29, 2:55:45 PM] Rob Feeny: There is a switch version available, and this is an external dimmer we've purchased from the LED guys on 1st & Boundary
[2019-01-29, 2:59:33 PM] Jamie: Right. Pretty vague. Have any other LEDS to test the dimmer on?
[2019-01-29, 3:00:14 PM] Jamie: I see where they wrote that they are dimmable but in the customer questions it says no. But also seems like a mix of reviews for the switched and non switched versions.
[2019-01-29, 3:01:32 PM] Rob Feeny: If you expand the comments, the remaining ones say "not dimmable as they come, you need an external dimmer"
[2019-01-29, 3:01:40 PM] Jamie: Ahhh ok
[2019-01-29, 3:01:54 PM] Jamie: The LED guys are pretty good
[2019-01-29, 3:01:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Sadly we're working in Chilliwack or I'd go into the store with a light and trouble with the LED guys
[2019-01-29, 3:07:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice little office

[2019-01-29, 4:26:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Solved the dimmer. Tim reversed the polarity on the while system
[2019-01-29, 4:44:36 PM] Jamie: Nice!
[2019-01-29, 4:44:48 PM] Jamie: So it dims?
[2019-01-29, 4:44:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep
[2019-01-29, 4:45:04 PM] Jamie: Right on
[2019-01-29, 4:45:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Now we're debating who's right, to me in AV, black is negative
[2019-01-29, 4:45:49 PM] Rob Feeny: To Tim, White is negative (I can't get him to stop saying neutral)
[2019-01-29, 4:46:07 PM] Jamie: Well in a car?
[2019-01-29, 4:47:07 PM] Jamie: Red is positive so black is negative.
[2019-01-29, 4:47:08 PM] Rob Feeny: That's what we're debating. Is this automotive wiring?
[2019-01-29, 4:47:19 PM] Jamie: It’s low voltage wiring
[2019-01-29, 4:49:57 PM] Rob Feeny: The wires are white and black tho
[2019-01-29, 4:50:12 PM] Rob Feeny: And the LED lights have white as negative!?
[2019-01-29, 5:31:22 PM] Jamie: Weird.

[2019-02-02, 1:27:18 PM] Rob Feeny: My professional load center setup
[2019-02-02, 5:40:05 PM] Jamie: Think 10m x 10m is too small a footprint for a 4 story building?
[2019-02-02, 5:40:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. That close to the coast the ground is probably pretty soft and the water table high
[2019-02-02, 5:43:15 PM] Jamie: From what I can tell if I try to save half the lot for parking / future sale, it leaves us with about 13m x 15m (roughly)
[2019-02-02, 5:43:54 PM] Jamie: What do you think a good footprint would be?
[2019-02-02, 5:46:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Which lot is it? The one near the beach? There's probably basically zero offset from the property line required
[2019-02-02, 5:46:38 PM] Jamie: The one I uploaded the video of, totally overgrown.
[2019-02-02, 5:47:04 PM] Jamie: Yeah some of the space is for a garden at the back. 3.5m
[2019-02-02, 5:47:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, if the street fronting was straight up but the back side was more like a slope (each floor smaller than the one below) it would be more stablr
[2019-02-02, 5:48:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe use one side as access to the back, have the driveway go under the second floor
[2019-02-02, 5:48:44 PM] Jamie: There is parking in the alley seems like
[2019-02-02, 5:48:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Just anything that stops it from being a tall block that's taller than it is wide
[2019-02-02, 5:49:18 PM] Rob Feeny: And if you give 3 m per floor it's 12m tall
[2019-02-02, 5:49:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Gotta drive for 5min
[2019-02-02, 5:49:40 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2019-02-02, 5:55:24 PM] Rob Feeny: I love the idea of keeping half the top floor as a deck/garden but then that only leaves 5mx10m for living
[2019-02-02, 5:55:54 PM] Jamie: Yeah and if no kitchen up there, have to go down to floors to cook and share with tenants
[2019-02-02, 5:55:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Which is totally doable but if we all want to visit at the same time..  although I suppose we could just take a hostel room
[2019-02-02, 5:56:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Small kitchen then outdoor cooking area as well?
[2019-02-02, 5:57:20 PM] Jamie: actually that’s a good idea. Maybe just a fridge and a bbq with sink up there
[2019-02-02, 5:58:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Then a countertop gas burner for when it's raining?
[2019-02-02, 5:59:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe cover half the patio area with trellis and climbing vines, half open to the sky
[2019-02-02, 5:59:40 PM] Jamie: Yeah. Might just have to go downstairs to cook, depending on the room. Have to keep the build cost down for sure
[2019-02-02, 6:00:35 PM] Jamie: Really just tying to see if what we want can for on half the lot. Would be smart to keep that clear for the future
[2019-02-02, 6:00:42 PM] Jamie: fit*
[2019-02-02, 6:00:50 PM] Rob Feeny: What's the lowest temperature they ever see there?
[2019-02-02, 6:01:56 PM] Jamie: On the coast, 20 degrees
[2019-02-02, 6:02:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha nice, and do you need ac? The top floor might catch breezes
[2019-02-02, 6:06:11 PM] Jamie: I think it would be fine but I’m sure Myles would want it, at least on the top floor. Better for airBNB too
[2019-02-02, 6:07:22 PM] Jamie: I’m thinking about a caretakers room on the bottom floor with the kitchen and open lounge (that could be parking). Makes sense to have someone live there full time
[2019-02-02, 6:07:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Totally. Reception/caretaker etc
[2019-02-02, 6:07:58 PM] Jamie: Any estimate how long a staircase would be to rise the 9 feet?
[2019-02-02, 6:08:06 PM] Jamie: Estimate is done
[2019-02-02, 6:08:09 PM] Jamie: Fine*
[2019-02-02, 6:08:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Might be nicer to have the kitchen on the 3rd floor
[2019-02-02, 6:08:48 PM] Rob Feeny: About 12ft
[2019-02-02, 6:09:10 PM] Rob Feeny: But down there you could do what you want. Natural feeling would be 11-12ft
[2019-02-02, 6:09:21 PM] Rob Feeny: 8" high risers about 9" deep
[2019-02-02, 6:09:59 PM] Jamie: Yeah we have room I think. Just plotting out a few things.
[2019-02-02, 6:10:25 PM] Jamie: I like the idea of picnic style tables close to the kitchen. It would use up almost the whole 3rd floor
[2019-02-02, 6:10:52 PM] Jamie: But it would be better for most
[2019-02-02, 6:12:06 PM] Jamie: You would be better at designing this than me, lol
[2019-02-02, 6:12:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Put all the public gathering type things on the 3rd floor and have it side open for air to blow through and for the view
[2019-02-02, 6:13:26 PM] Rob Feeny: *wide open
[2019-02-02, 6:13:41 PM] Jamie: Ok then we could have gaden facing rooms on the ground floor. 2 good spaces
[2019-02-02, 6:13:57 PM] Jamie: Garden*
[2019-02-02, 6:13:58 PM] Rob Feeny: The ground floor would be sleeping spots like dorms etc because they'll stay cool
[2019-02-02, 6:14:14 PM] Rob Feeny: And quieter
[2019-02-02, 6:14:35 PM] Jamie: We lose the parking spot if we do that
[2019-02-02, 6:14:48 PM] Jamie: But most people don’t have cars here
‎[2019-02-02, 6:42:03 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-02, 6:54:45 PM] Rob Feeny: 871 is still quite a bit of space
[2019-02-02, 6:54:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Which was is the beach?
[2019-02-02, 6:56:00 PM] Rob Feeny: I was going to ask which way is south but it's Ecuador...
[2019-02-02, 6:56:30 PM] Jamie: The 12m side points at the beach
‎[2019-02-02, 7:00:39 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-02, 7:01:12 PM] Jamie: Found a garage door?
[2019-02-02, 7:02:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. $180
[2019-02-02, 7:03:01 PM] Jamie: Good score. Brand new
[2019-02-02, 7:03:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup5ft side by 6ft tall
[2019-02-02, 7:03:51 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll install it tomorrow, I have to take apart some of Daniel's work to do it
[2019-02-02, 7:04:25 PM] Rob Feeny: On that design, what would you think of pushing out the right hand wall to increase the space on the beachward side patio?
[2019-02-02, 7:04:51 PM] Rob Feeny: 2m isn't a lot of gathering space
[2019-02-02, 7:06:59 PM] Jamie: Yeah we have room. Kitchen is 9 feet long
[2019-02-02, 7:07:05 PM] Jamie: How much?
[2019-02-02, 7:08:37 PM] Rob Feeny: You might eliminate it altogether to give more space. That big space would give you a part that overlooks the garden
[2019-02-02, 7:08:46 PM] Rob Feeny: I just see that side patio and never getting used
[2019-02-02, 7:09:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Now imagine a roll-up door on the beach side...
[2019-02-02, 7:09:42 PM] Rob Feeny: So the entire wall opens up
[2019-02-02, 7:11:01 PM] Rob Feeny: I just love the idea that in a tropical country you can blend inside and outside
[2019-02-02, 7:11:20 PM] Jamie: The beach is west on the drawing. So lose the north balcony and add some space to the west one?
[2019-02-02, 7:12:07 PM] Jamie: Me too. Absolutely.
[2019-02-02, 7:12:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'm a bit confused. You said the 12m side pointed at the beach?
[2019-02-02, 7:12:47 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-02-02, 7:13:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I meant right hand wall as the drawing is sent, not drawn
[2019-02-02, 7:13:56 PM] Jamie: Yeah it’s sideways, lol. That’s why I gave orientation. Less confusing
[2019-02-02, 7:14:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok so yes the North balcony
[2019-02-02, 7:14:34 PM] Rob Feeny: In favor of East
[2019-02-02, 7:14:56 PM] Rob Feeny: If the beach is on the 12m side, that's East not West, correct?
[2019-02-02, 7:14:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha
[2019-02-02, 7:15:30 PM] Jamie: No. Beach is definitely west.
[2019-02-02, 7:15:40 PM] Jamie: This is comical 🤣
[2019-02-02, 7:15:58 PM] Jamie: Stairs are on the east side
‎[2019-02-02, 7:16:10 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-02, 7:16:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Got it
[2019-02-02, 7:16:21 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-02-02, 7:16:25 PM] Rob Feeny: That's the patio we want to be hige
[2019-02-02, 7:16:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Huge
[2019-02-02, 7:16:42 PM] Jamie: So 3 meters?
[2019-02-02, 7:16:46 PM] Jamie: 4?
‎[2019-02-02, 7:17:24 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-02, 7:17:40 PM] Rob Feeny: What do you think of something like that? Gives you some garden facing patio as well
[2019-02-02, 7:18:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Make the ceiling higher on the top floor to make it feel bigger
[2019-02-02, 7:18:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Although we'll need an access to the very top roof because that's where the water tanks will probably be. But that could be a steep metal stair on the balcony
[2019-02-02, 7:18:48 PM] Jamie: I was thinking the same. That corner will be the killer sunset view
[2019-02-02, 7:18:57 PM] Jamie: Right good point
[2019-02-02, 7:19:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I wouldn't worry about it feeling too small inside if you can make that whole wall open up
[2019-02-02, 7:30:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Door successfully transported
[2019-02-05, 7:15:44 PM] Jamie: Hey any chance you know an architect or lawyer in Ecuador?
[2019-02-05, 7:18:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I know a lawyer in Quito
[2019-02-05, 7:18:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Who would probably know an architect
[2019-02-05, 7:18:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Did I ever introduce you to Abel?
[2019-02-05, 7:20:13 PM] Jamie: I think so. I may have a lawyer actually, just got an email, but I will very much need help finding a cost effective designer / architect to make some plans.
[2019-02-05, 7:20:45 PM] Jamie: Yeah I have him on Facebook. Shit. Should have talked to him first before hiring this lawyer.
[2019-02-05, 7:24:37 PM] Jamie: Does he go by Abel or David?
[2019-02-05, 7:38:51 PM] Rob Feeny: I've always known his as Abel
[2019-02-05, 7:38:57 PM] Rob Feeny: It's like Juan Carlos
[2019-02-05, 7:39:00 PM] Rob Feeny: *him

[2019-02-05, 8:36:30 PM] Rob Feeny: How many guys does it take to weigh a tiny house?
[2019-02-06, 2:54:51 PM] Jamie: I found a lady who might want to split the lot
[2019-02-06, 2:55:17 PM] Jamie: Rather, she was also trying to buy it and we would be competing but she only wants half and I would be happy with that
[2019-02-06, 2:55:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yah? Local?
[2019-02-06, 2:55:50 PM] Jamie: Nope. Canadian from Ontario. Wants to open a yoga retreat. Might be perfect to be beside that.
[2019-02-06, 2:56:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha very true...
[2019-02-06, 2:56:13 PM] Rob Feeny: And distracting ;)
[2019-02-06, 2:56:16 PM] Jamie: Getting some INSANE prices per square meter building. Like $1000 a meter
[2019-02-06, 2:56:19 PM] Rob Feeny: But good synergy
[2019-02-06, 2:56:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap
[2019-02-06, 2:56:33 PM] Jamie: So 2 floors would be $230k USD
[2019-02-06, 2:56:51 PM] Jamie: Don’t think I will use him ha
[2019-02-06, 2:57:05 PM] Jamie: And her overflow cools fill my beds
[2019-02-06, 2:57:10 PM] Jamie: could*
[2019-02-06, 3:02:00 PM] Rob Feeny: In more ways than one haha
[2019-02-06, 3:03:47 PM] Jamie: 😎
[2019-02-12, 11:35:07 PM] Rob Feeny: So in back to using my MyFitnessPal to track calories. I feel like I ate half the world and it still says I'm short calories
[2019-02-12, 11:35:35 PM] Rob Feeny: *I'm back to
[2019-02-13, 6:10:35 PM] Jamie: Must be healthy food. I remember eating a huge plate of broccoli and cauliflower and it was less than 300 calories.
[2019-02-13, 6:11:35 PM] Jamie: I’m trying intermittent fasting. Only eat for 8 hrs a day then fasting (coffee, water and tea) for the other 16. Interesting idea
[2019-02-13, 6:12:17 PM] Jamie: Makes me drink more water to stave off the hunger. I eat from 12-8pm. No no breakfast. So far I like it
[2019-02-13, 6:18:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm interesting. Coffee for breakfast?
[2019-02-13, 6:18:41 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd have to learn to like black coffee
[2019-02-13, 6:20:36 PM] Jamie: Or tea. Honestly it feels good to give my body time to digest what I have eaten.  After 8 hrs of eating, letting my body have some time to work before shoveling more in feels good. By noon I’m so happy to eat, I enjoy the heck out of it. Also not eating late is beneficial but hard with other people
[2019-02-13, 6:21:27 PM] Jamie: Not for everyone but it seems to be working for me. I feel leaner and more efficient.
[2019-02-13, 6:22:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice. I need the coffee in the am to poop though!
[2019-02-13, 6:23:44 PM] Rob Feeny: But I've really been struggling with my eating habits lately. I feel like I've been massively overeating and always kind of bloated, so it was a real surprise to see that I'm under my calorie targets for each day
[2019-02-13, 6:23:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe I should give the fasting a shot
[2019-02-13, 6:25:12 PM] Jamie: Totally. Part of the reason I am trying it is because I kept feeling bloated when surfing. And I was eating out of boredom a lot, now I’m aware of it.
[2019-02-13, 6:25:46 PM] Jamie: I’m curious what you are eating. Screen shot the MyFitnessPal?
[2019-02-13, 6:25:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yes. It's on my list of "escapist activities" - Eating for distraction, no sustenance
[2019-02-13, 6:26:39 PM] Jamie: Yes I really do that. And at night desserts but if I can’t eat after 8, it helps to avoid it
[2019-02-13, 6:27:51 PM] Rob Feeny: I had to reinstall it and lost everything so I restarted yesterday

[2019-02-13, 6:30:13 PM] Jamie: Oh I forgot to ask. What’s your macro ratio? That was key for me
[2019-02-13, 6:31:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Pretty bad
‎[2019-02-13, 6:31:42 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-13, 6:31:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Been a tough couple weeks, trying to get back to a healthier mind/body state
[2019-02-13, 6:32:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh and it turns out Rob paid Morgan for that work I did, he's just had too many expenses and can't pay me the 8k remaining
[2019-02-13, 6:33:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Buuuut he can afford to pay for his two sugar babies and take them out for lunch...
[2019-02-13, 6:33:34 PM] Jamie: Ah you need to start somewhere with your food. I’m jealous you are in a place you can track it. Here? Ya right
[2019-02-13, 6:34:00 PM] Jamie: Oh crap. I’m sure he’s good for it but it’s sucks you have to be his bank
[2019-02-13, 6:34:44 PM] Jamie: I’m really waiting for that to implode in a spectacular show of fireworks.
[2019-02-13, 6:34:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. I'm headed to El Salvador in a week and hadn't had any significant income in a month so it's stressing me out
[2019-02-13, 6:34:54 PM] Jamie: Need money?
[2019-02-13, 6:35:08 PM] Jamie: I could email you 3k
[2019-02-13, 6:35:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha well at least your food is less processed? It scares me that I am able to scan 90% of what I eat from the barcode
[2019-02-13, 6:35:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Naw, I've got my line of credit but that WAS paid down
[2019-02-13, 6:35:59 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a shell game but the mental calm that comes with decreasing numbers helps
[2019-02-13, 6:36:01 PM] Rob Feeny: But thanks
[2019-02-13, 6:36:20 PM] Jamie: Well say the word. It’s easier to pay me back than a line of credit
[2019-02-13, 6:38:08 PM] Jamie: As for your macros, I always tried to front load my day. Low(ish) fat, high protein shakes in the morning meant I could slide later in the day and still end up right. And hard boiled eggs were a great snack for getting the protein higher
[2019-02-13, 6:43:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah I actually should modify my salad recipe as each one has a hard boiled egg now
[2019-02-13, 6:43:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yes but the line of credit stresses me out less ;)
[2019-02-13, 6:44:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm more comfortable owing the bank money than people
[2019-02-13, 6:45:19 PM] Jamie: Ok I get that. Had it out with my financial guy and sold everything yesterday. Maybe $5k in profit in 15 months. Low tax year and he sucked
[2019-02-13, 6:46:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn. Where did you know him from?
[2019-02-13, 6:48:35 PM] Jamie: Long story. Met a guy that someone recommended even though he worked for ScotiaBank. Talked with him and totally felt in sync. Sent him 37k and then he barely responded for 2 months. Went back to his manager who set me up with this guy. Good at talking but shitty on the details and following through. My spreadsheet says Scotiabank made 5k in management fees on me. So they go half the profit
[2019-02-13, 6:49:06 PM] Jamie: Fuck that.
[2019-02-13, 6:50:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Cripes
[2019-02-13, 6:50:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, sounds like we're in the wrong business
[2019-02-13, 6:53:03 PM] Jamie: I agree. He did nothing but buy the funds and sell the funds.
[2019-02-13, 6:57:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Which you could have done online for 1k
[2019-02-13, 7:23:42 PM] Jamie: How’s everything overall? I know winter is often tough on you. Looking forward to El Salvador?
[2019-02-13, 7:25:16 PM] Rob Feeny: It's ok. Not great. That big project I was working on got put on hold at the same time Morgan slowed down and  I spent a whole lot of money so it's been tough mentally
[2019-02-13, 7:25:34 PM] Rob Feeny: But I'm getting better at balancing my mental state
[2019-02-13, 7:26:15 PM] Rob Feeny: El salvador will be good, although Derek is AWOL and I had hoped to stay with him for part of the trip, so I might be doing Airbnb in the city
[2019-02-13, 7:26:31 PM] Rob Feeny: I had also hoped to have a full bank account heading down :S
[2019-02-13, 7:27:00 PM] Rob Feeny: But hey, it's hard to argue with sun, sand, surf and cheap food
[2019-02-13, 7:27:18 PM] Jamie: Yeah that would be better. But my guess is when you get back, business will pick up
[2019-02-13, 7:27:30 PM] Jamie: Yeah the sun and ocean are great for mental state
[2019-02-13, 7:27:48 PM] Rob Feeny: I intend to swim and run a bunch
[2019-02-13, 7:27:52 PM] Rob Feeny: And do some yoga
[2019-02-13, 7:29:07 PM] Jamie: I want to get into yoga when I come back for the summer.
[2019-02-13, 7:29:39 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a good thing to get into. Mental and physical.
[2019-02-13, 7:31:57 PM] Jamie: It’s really isn’t cheap though. Hard to rationalize with no income. Might do some cash electrical jobs in Kelowna for some cash. I don’t like being a month behind on my learning code.
[2019-02-13, 7:32:10 PM] Jamie: Losing wifi. Later dude
[2019-02-13, 7:32:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Adios
‎[2019-02-13, 7:36:59 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-13, 7:41:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks fancy. Strange bottle
[2019-02-13, 7:42:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Any update on the real estate thing?
[2019-02-13, 7:43:21 PM] Jamie: Slowly. I have a lawyer researching the price we should offer. Slowly. Talked to her today and she is going to get back to me. Slowly. Ha
[2019-02-13, 7:43:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Welcome to Latin America haha
[2019-02-13, 7:43:55 PM] Jamie: I’m learning about the process. And finding builders.
[2019-02-13, 7:44:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I know a couple of Mexican architects (they're newer grads though)
[2019-02-13, 7:44:40 PM] Jamie: Slow is ok. Did I tell you I found someone that wants to split the lot?
[2019-02-13, 7:49:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes the yoga lady? Could work well indeed
[2019-02-13, 7:49:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Can't recall, local or foreign?
[2019-02-13, 7:49:49 PM] Jamie: From Canada
[2019-02-13, 7:49:53 PM] Jamie: Ontario
[2019-02-13, 7:50:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, so easier to deal with
[2019-02-13, 7:52:16 PM] Jamie: Totally. It would be nice to get a 200m2 lot for $30k or less. Think that is small?
[2019-02-13, 7:53:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm it's not a lot of space
[2019-02-13, 7:54:00 PM] Rob Feeny: But I guess there are no setbacks etc like here
[2019-02-13, 7:57:08 PM] Jamie: Maybe some. I’m waiting on the actually dimensions. And small and high doesn’t seem to be a problem
[2019-02-17, 4:53:26 PM] Jamie: Hey what is the site that gives me the cheapest flights without a specific date? If I am flexible with departure?
[2019-02-17, 4:53:45 PM] Rob Feeny: That's just Google flight search
[2019-02-17, 4:54:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Or there kayak, tell it how much you have and approximately when and it'll show you where you can go
[2019-02-17, 4:56:25 PM] Jamie: Hmm google flights doesn’t work here. I will try Kayak. In El salvador yet?
[2019-02-17, 4:56:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope, Wednesday
‎[2019-02-17, 4:56:41 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-17, 4:56:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Lunch break
[2019-02-17, 4:57:15 PM] Rob Feeny: It doesn't? What if you use a proxy site?
[2019-02-17, 5:01:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Try heading to google.com/ncr
[2019-02-17, 5:01:37 PM] Rob Feeny: That prevents the redirect to local google
[2019-02-17, 5:02:14 PM] Jamie: Sweet. That should help. I also realized  I can use my VPN. Just need to download the app
[2019-02-17, 5:02:43 PM] Jamie: Is this at the guys house still?
[2019-02-17, 5:02:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect. When Graz looked at flights in El Salvador they were always more expensive than when I looked for them from Canada
[2019-02-17, 5:02:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup
[2019-02-17, 5:02:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Framed up the new back wall yesterday
[2019-02-17, 5:03:36 PM] Jamie: Having fun?
[2019-02-17, 5:03:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, it's nice to build something
[2019-02-17, 5:04:14 PM] Rob Feeny: But everything takes 3x later than you expect...
[2019-02-17, 5:04:25 PM] Jamie: Of course.
[2019-02-17, 5:04:50 PM] Rob Feeny: And costs 2x what you expect
[2019-02-17, 5:05:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh well. I just want to get it ncie and sealed up before I go away
[2019-02-17, 5:05:22 PM] Jamie: Looking forward to surfing?
[2019-02-17, 5:05:24 PM] Rob Feeny: When do you leave Ecuador?
[2019-02-17, 5:05:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha not really tbh, I'm so bad it's not really surfing
[2019-02-17, 5:05:53 PM] Rob Feeny: But I'll get out a few mornings and practice
[2019-02-17, 5:06:12 PM] Jamie: On the 23rd. Land in Calgary on the 24th. Doesn’t look like PopaRide is going to have anything for me, might have to fly
[2019-02-17, 5:06:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm well lots of people out their rides up late
[2019-02-17, 5:06:53 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet Monday some will pop up
[2019-02-17, 5:07:09 PM] Rob Feeny: I just used PopaRide to send a toilet to Oliver haha
[2019-02-17, 5:07:46 PM] Jamie: That’s priceless. I thought about sending my box of stuff from Calgary to Kelowna without me
[2019-02-17, 5:08:30 PM] Rob Feeny: The price is good.. I found a brand new composting toilet in a salvage store, bought it for 800 and sold it for 1200 a week oater
[2019-02-17, 5:08:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Plus I wrote it off as a business expense 😄
[2019-02-17, 5:13:26 PM] Jamie: Fantastic! Tax free?
[2019-02-17, 5:13:54 PM] Rob Feeny: I paid tax on it but will get the gst back

[2019-02-18, 12:05:38 PM] Jamie: Lots of hours!
[2019-02-18, 12:05:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep busy week. Got lots to do in El Salvador too
[2019-02-18, 12:06:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Today is packing and cleaning
[2019-02-18, 12:06:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Don't want to come back to chaos
[2019-02-18, 12:07:04 PM] Jamie: Always a good idea. Nice to walk into a clean place when back
[2019-02-18, 12:07:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Just booked Papayas Lodge in El Tunco, $22. It hasn't gone up at all 👍🏻
[2019-02-18, 12:08:05 PM] Jamie: Gotta love that.
[2019-02-18, 12:08:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Now if Morgan would just pay me!
[2019-02-18, 12:09:08 PM] Jamie: Still nothing, huh?
[2019-02-18, 12:09:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope. He finally admitted he's just broke
[2019-02-18, 12:09:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Moving and having a baby is t good for the expenses
[2019-02-18, 12:09:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Isn't
[2019-02-18, 12:10:33 PM] Jamie: No shit. He has to focus back on AV. It’s been the driver for all this for him
[2019-02-18, 12:10:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. And maybe trim one of his mistresses
[2019-02-18, 12:12:44 PM] Jamie: True
[2019-02-19, 7:53:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I've gotten too good at this. My pack is 22lbs
[2019-02-19, 7:53:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I guess I can bring back 30lbs of stuff?
[2019-02-19, 7:59:11 PM] Jamie: What the heck would you bring back
[2019-02-19, 7:59:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Coffee. Lots and lots of coffee
[2019-02-19, 7:59:57 PM] Rob Feeny: And booze.
[2019-02-19, 8:01:49 PM] Jamie: Fair enough
[2019-02-19, 8:03:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I tried to think if I had left anything out but.. 2x shorts, 2x pants, 5 shirts, board shorts. Hammocks and books. Computer is in my carry-on
[2019-02-19, 8:03:51 PM] Jamie: Underwear.
[2019-02-19, 8:03:57 PM] Jamie: Shoes?
[2019-02-19, 8:03:59 PM] Jamie: Socks?
[2019-02-19, 8:03:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Meh.
[2019-02-19, 8:04:02 PM] Jamie: Haha
[2019-02-19, 8:04:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Wearing one pair, carrying runners. Flip-flops are in there..
[2019-02-19, 8:04:57 PM] Jamie: I have so many toiletries and electronics. It takes up lots of space
[2019-02-19, 8:05:29 PM] Jamie: And my trimmer and razors / shaving cream too. I want a good electric when I get to Canada
[2019-02-19, 8:05:46 PM] Jamie: Shirt for surfing in?
[2019-02-19, 8:05:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I've got my electric, my toiletries etc
[2019-02-19, 8:06:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I usually just borrow. But that reminds me I have rashguard
[2019-02-19, 8:06:19 PM] Jamie: Bug spray!
[2019-02-19, 8:06:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Was going to buy it there
[2019-02-19, 8:06:49 PM] Rob Feeny: But the bugs are never bad in El tunco
[2019-02-19, 8:08:30 PM] Jamie: Sounds like you got it all
[2019-02-19, 8:08:38 PM] Jamie: When’s your flight?
[2019-02-19, 8:08:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Tomorrow at 840
[2019-02-19, 8:08:52 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm going stir crazy waiting
[2019-02-19, 8:09:08 PM] Jamie: I’m sure
[2019-02-22, 2:22:19 PM] Rob Feeny: You survivedm
[2019-02-22, 2:22:20 PM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2019-02-22, 2:22:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Scary shit...
[2019-02-22, 2:30:50 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-02-22, 2:31:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't think I've ever felt on that strong
[2019-02-22, 2:34:38 PM] Jamie: Did you get in the water yet?
[2019-02-22, 2:34:43 PM] Jamie: 🏄‍♀️
[2019-02-22, 2:35:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yep but the waves were garbage
[2019-02-22, 2:35:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Today I'm fairly hung over after drinking with John Kim and smoking cigars
[2019-02-22, 2:35:33 PM] Rob Feeny: But I expected that
[2019-02-22, 2:36:27 PM] Jamie: Hah found him, hey?
[2019-02-22, 2:37:01 PM] Rob Feeny: He was staying in Tunco, had dinner with him and his wife and another couple
[2019-02-22, 2:37:31 PM] Jamie: Very cool. How did it feel to go for a swim? Nice to get in some warm water?
[2019-02-22, 2:37:47 PM] Rob Feeny: So great. Just floated in the waves for so long
[2019-02-22, 2:38:02 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm contemplating lunch then doing it again
[2019-02-22, 2:38:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Where are you now?
[2019-02-22, 2:38:11 PM] Jamie: Good life.
[2019-02-24, 9:29:02 AM] Jamie: Getting back into the surf mode?
[2019-02-24, 10:49:00 AM] Rob Feeny: To be honest, not really
[2019-02-24, 10:49:14 AM] Rob Feeny: I think one day I'll have to take a surf camp to get back into it
[2019-02-24, 1:21:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man now my laptop trackpad is starting to go haywire
[2019-02-24, 1:22:05 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't think MacBooks like tropical countries
[2019-02-24, 3:12:30 PM] Jamie: That was the same problem with mine. Has to be a solution
[2019-02-24, 3:13:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm almost certain it's the battery swelling
[2019-02-24, 3:13:42 PM] Rob Feeny: I recall having the same problem and replacing the battery solved it
[2019-02-24, 3:13:56 PM] Rob Feeny: But you don't have a user replaceable battery do you?
[2019-02-24, 3:14:35 PM] Jamie: Not sure. It wasn’t the battery. It was a corroded wire that was shorting out the controller for the keyboard and the trackpad
[2019-02-24, 3:14:58 PM] Jamie: If it is the battery swelling and pressing on the wire to the trackpad, you should be able to replicate it by pushing on different parts
[2019-02-24, 3:16:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok i put it away for now and was going to pick up a mouse tomorrow
[2019-02-24, 3:17:17 PM] Rob Feeny: But even when it's just sitting there, the cursor jumps around and clicks
[2019-02-24, 3:20:35 PM] Jamie: Yeah my just stopped working completely... sometimes
[2019-02-24, 3:27:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Frustrating. I need to get some work done soon
[2019-02-24, 3:28:06 PM] Jamie: Yeah I know that pain. Did you try all the resets? DRAM, SRAM (whatever they are called)?
[2019-02-24, 3:28:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope not yet. Got frustrated and put it away haha
[2019-02-24, 3:29:37 PM] Jamie: Maybe a product niche. Rice filled laptop storage case, lol
[2019-02-24, 3:30:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep. It was the hear and humidity and the ants here that caused problems
[2019-02-24, 3:30:17 PM] Rob Feeny: But I'm curious if it will work again once I take it into air conditioning
[2019-02-24, 4:35:54 PM] Jamie: And the airline lost my luggage, haha. I’m in shorts and it’s -17
‎[2019-02-24, 4:44:17 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-24, 4:44:22 PM] Rob Feeny: I really feel ya man
[2019-02-24, 4:44:25 PM] Rob Feeny: 😅
[2019-02-24, 10:29:13 PM] Jamie: My computer works again. 🤨
[2019-02-24, 11:37:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha see! It's the temperature and humidity
[2019-02-24, 11:37:47 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet mine will be normal when I get home
[2019-02-25, 9:49:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Did you get your luggage yet?
[2019-02-25, 9:49:50 AM] Jamie: Nope
[2019-02-25, 9:50:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Ah damn. Did you have to buy warm clothes?
[2019-02-25, 9:51:06 AM] Jamie: Just pants. Bought some sweet comfy sweat pants from MEC that I will bill to the airlines. But I left my sweaters, down jacket and boots here with Darren so I have that.
[2019-02-25, 9:51:21 AM] Jamie: Gonna have to buy a T-shirt or two today and some boxers
[2019-02-25, 9:51:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh perfect. And how's it feel to be back?
[2019-02-25, 9:51:40 AM] Jamie: 🥶
[2019-02-25, 9:51:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha I bet.
[2019-02-25, 9:51:56 AM] Jamie: Lol. But loving good internet
[2019-02-25, 9:53:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah I went from my home 300 Mbps to pure shite
[2019-02-25, 9:53:51 AM] Jamie: Mixed feelings about my computer working. Although I should have probably tried it more often, after about 3 days of testing it randomly, I just accepted it, never tried again. Probably could have gotten many hours of programming in
[2019-02-25, 9:54:09 AM] Jamie: The only reason I came back was to get it fixed
[2019-02-25, 9:54:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh damn. Frustrating. But something is clearly wrong...
[2019-02-25, 9:55:35 AM] Rob Feeny: I was talking with Dan about the possibility of just using team viewer to work remotely and have the processing down back home but I think the internet would be too slow
[2019-02-25, 9:55:57 AM] Jamie: Yup. I really do think my mindset is changed in the last 18 months. I can really see two ways to look at it.
[2019-02-25, 9:56:47 AM] Jamie: 1. Cost me an extra $1200 to get back to Ecuador and I never would have lost my luggage if the computer hadn’t broken so that hassle too
[2019-02-25, 9:58:10 AM] Jamie: 2. This is the direction my life needed to go. Something that will happen here in Canada while I am shopping for new clothes and getting my computer fixed is important for my life.
[2019-02-25, 9:58:42 AM] Jamie: Kinda mystical and deep but sure makes the moment easier and less grumpy!
[2019-02-25, 9:58:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Exactly. "así es la vida"
[2019-02-25, 9:59:20 AM] Jamie: Es verdad
[2019-02-25, 9:59:25 AM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2019-02-25, 9:59:54 AM] Jamie: Try dehumidifying you computer with rice. Every suggested it but I didn’t do it
[2019-02-25, 10:00:01 AM] Rob Feeny: Plus you get to harass Darren's rugrats and enjoy some snow
[2019-02-25, 10:00:24 AM] Rob Feeny: I've left it right where the AC blows on it all night. Got to the city late last night
[2019-02-25, 10:00:37 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll check it out in a bit, coffee time atm
[2019-02-25, 10:00:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Sadly the coffee isn't amazing
[2019-02-25, 10:01:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Better in El Tunco. I'm bringing 5lbs back to Canada haha
[2019-02-25, 10:01:27 AM] Jamie: Haha so you are done with el tunco!
[2019-02-25, 10:01:29 AM] Jamie: ?
[2019-02-25, 10:01:41 AM] Rob Feeny: So when you go back to ecuador will it be to olon or montanita?
[2019-02-25, 10:02:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Yes for now. Might for back for 2 nights at the end and go to the airport from there
[2019-02-25, 10:03:52 AM] Jamie: I’m done with Montañita. Olón is so much quieter, better beach and over all vibe and it’s only $1.50 by taxi to go to Montañita for food or party
[2019-02-25, 10:05:53 AM] Jamie: Bought this last night...
[2019-02-25, 10:05:56 AM] Jamie: https://www.amazon.ca/Portable-Quadcopter-Ultimate-Backpack-Bundle/dp/B073ZHGXKF/ref=aw_pd_cart_vw_crc_1_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B073ZHGXKF&pd_rd_r=0HH1D3Z7Z565JZHKWQ7D&pd_rd_w=ngkZY&pd_rd_wg=387Vm&pf_rd_p=db9d0de6-220b-4d62-a27a-70c3cc704a24&pf_rd_r=0HH1D3Z7Z565JZHKWQ7D&psc=1&refRID=0HH1D3Z7Z565JZHKWQ7D
[2019-02-25, 10:08:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow the full kit
[2019-02-25, 10:08:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Second career?
[2019-02-25, 10:09:33 AM] Jamie: Maybe. I really think I can make money (cash, USD) videoing surfers with the Spanish school surf lessons.
[2019-02-25, 10:10:02 AM] Jamie: And I’ve wanted one for a while. So why not?
[2019-02-25, 10:10:39 AM] Jamie: Could be just an income source while down there, if not great way to make friends
[2019-02-25, 10:11:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Totally
[2019-02-25, 10:11:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Something for when you're not coding or learning Spanish
[2019-02-25, 10:12:44 AM] Jamie: Yup. And could lead to skill video editing which also can be an online income (need good internet though)
[2019-02-25, 10:12:48 AM] Rob Feeny: I forgot how unsettling it is to have people hovering awaiting your every command
[2019-02-25, 10:13:00 AM] Jamie: Haha where are you?
[2019-02-25, 10:13:04 AM] Jamie: Coffee shop?
[2019-02-25, 10:13:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Hotel
[2019-02-25, 10:13:25 AM] Rob Feeny: A boutique hotel which is really just a converted house
[2019-02-25, 10:13:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Under construction
[2019-02-25, 10:13:41 AM] Jamie: Funny. It’s rarely like that in Ecuador after your initial order. Have to flag them down
[2019-02-25, 10:14:10 AM] Rob Feeny: I gave him a tip last night so think he's hungry now
[2019-02-25, 10:14:34 AM] Jamie: Your Spanish still good?
[2019-02-25, 10:14:51 AM] Rob Feeny: You should check out Visual Chemists off my Instagram, it's my friends Dan & Alex, they make some amazing drone videos and you can steal ideas
[2019-02-25, 10:15:22 AM] Rob Feeny: My Spanish is a lot better than when I lived here. I still study and I practice a lot in Canada
[2019-02-25, 10:15:39 AM] Rob Feeny: I have friends that I have been chatting with in WhatsApp in Spanish for years now
[2019-02-25, 10:16:23 AM] Rob Feeny: You getting more comfortable with it?
[2019-02-25, 10:16:54 AM] Jamie: Sure. Everyday. But not at a real conversational level yet
[2019-02-25, 10:17:56 AM] Rob Feeny: But you can get shit done?
[2019-02-25, 10:21:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey do you know if we were immunized against measles? I'm almost certain we were but it's not like I'm going to ask Mom
[2019-02-25, 10:24:27 AM] Jamie: Yeah somewhat. Need to get back in the habit of talking Spanish not English
[2019-02-25, 10:24:35 AM] Jamie: Not sure but I will find out today
[2019-02-25, 10:29:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome. Too many cases popping up in Vancouver
[2019-02-25, 10:37:40 AM] Jamie: I know!
[2019-02-25, 10:44:10 AM] Rob Feeny: Damnit computer is still buggy
[2019-02-25, 11:29:42 AM] Jamie: Lame
[2019-02-25, 11:36:37 AM] Rob Feeny: And Franco still hasn't brought me the local SIM card he promised. It's killing me. That thing is my freedom. I've offered to come by his office but he isn't responding
[2019-02-25, 11:37:04 AM] Jamie: Shitty. So you’re locked to wifi zones
[2019-02-25, 11:37:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Exactly
[2019-02-25, 11:37:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Can't even take an uber
[2019-02-25, 3:59:23 PM] Rob Feeny: So Dan got me set up on his VPN, it's working well and it would let you access Canadian sites from El Salvador. Like Google flight search..
[2019-02-25, 4:43:31 PM] Jamie: Nice!  I forgot I had signed up for one and it works too
[2019-02-25, 7:58:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, load calculation question for you. I did the load calculation for all the AC stuff. Now I am doing the DC but I need to see how much AC current the converter will pull to create the 12Amps DC the system needs
[2019-02-25, 7:58:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm pretty sure it's just 1.2A
[2019-02-25, 7:58:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Just doubting myself
[2019-02-25, 7:59:30 PM] Jamie: 12v dc?
[2019-02-25, 7:59:51 PM] Rob Feeny: This unit has both AC and DC systems
[2019-02-25, 8:00:00 PM] Rob Feeny: But they supply they check is the AC one
[2019-02-25, 8:00:24 PM] Rob Feeny: And no, it just worked out that all the 12V DC stuff together adds up to 12Amps
[2019-02-25, 8:00:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Well 11.89A @ 12V DC
[2019-02-25, 8:01:33 PM] Rob Feeny: We designed the entire unit to run on less than 15A AC.
[2019-02-25, 8:01:39 PM] Jamie: Yeah at 120v it would be 1.19a
[2019-02-25, 8:01:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok that's what I was thinking thanks
[2019-02-25, 8:02:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha and the smallest RV load center is 35A DC
[2019-02-25, 8:03:41 PM] Jamie: Haha for a minute I thought you said it has AC. As it air conditioning and still under 15a
[2019-02-25, 8:05:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha nooo
[2019-02-25, 8:05:26 PM] Rob Feeny: It's pretty basic
[2019-02-27, 1:18:07 PM] Rob Feeny: How's Canada m
[2019-02-27, 1:18:09 PM] Rob Feeny: *?
[2019-02-27, 1:19:18 PM] Jamie: It’s good. Trapped in Calgary right now haha. I was supposed to have a ride this morning but he cancelled. Found another for Friday morning, hope it works out
[2019-02-27, 1:19:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah crap. And flights are too ridiculous?
[2019-02-27, 1:20:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you try the FB rideshare groups?
[2019-02-27, 1:20:13 PM] Jamie: $307 plus $30 bag fee
[2019-02-27, 1:20:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Cripes
[2019-02-27, 1:20:29 PM] Jamie: No, good idea. Let’s see if my Friday ride works
[2019-02-27, 1:20:37 PM] Jamie: Where you at?
[2019-02-27, 1:20:46 PM] Rob Feeny: A hostel in San Salvador
[2019-02-27, 1:20:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Waiting to have lunch with Clarissa
[2019-02-27, 1:21:17 PM] Rob Feeny: I so want to go back to the beach but have things here on Friday and the weekend
[2019-02-27, 1:23:27 PM] Jamie: How’s the hostel scene in San Salvador?
[2019-02-27, 1:29:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Rough. Not impressive
[2019-02-27, 1:29:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry lunch now ttys
[2019-02-27, 1:30:20 PM] Jamie: Later
‎[2019-02-27, 1:42:25 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-27, 1:42:53 PM] Jamie: Is that borscht?
[2019-02-27, 1:44:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Tortilla soup
[2019-02-27, 3:00:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you remember Clari?
[2019-02-27, 3:19:49 PM] Jamie: Vaguely
[2019-02-27, 3:26:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah ok, well I just had lunch with her. She's looking great
‎[2019-02-27, 3:29:22 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-02-27, 3:29:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I'm so photogenic
[2019-02-27, 3:32:13 PM] Jamie: Ahh I remember her now
[2019-02-27, 3:39:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Such a nice girl
[2019-03-02, 4:44:00 PM] Rob Feeny: How's reality?
[2019-03-02, 4:44:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you ever get your luggage?
[2019-03-02, 4:44:34 PM] Jamie: Nope. Not yet. Maybe it gets to Calgary tonight
[2019-03-02, 4:44:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Seriously? How do they lose something that thoroughly?
[2019-03-02, 4:45:03 PM] Jamie: Reality is good. Seeing Tana and Jeff tonight
[2019-03-02, 4:45:15 PM] Rob Feeny: How much are they paying you for that epic fuckup?
[2019-03-02, 4:45:16 PM] Jamie: I think it’s when they upgraded my flight from Lima to Houston the bag didn’t make it on there and somebody pulled the bag tags off
[2019-03-02, 4:45:30 PM] Jamie: I think all I can do is claim whatever stuff I had to buy to survive for last week
[2019-03-02, 4:45:31 PM] Rob Feeny: But they say they know where it is?
[2019-03-02, 4:45:56 PM] Jamie: Yes they say they know where it is but because it’s being shipped back to Canada through a flight other than United, they say they can’t trace it
[2019-03-02, 4:46:05 PM] Rob Feeny: But the flight was United?
[2019-03-02, 4:46:18 PM] Jamie: Yes
[2019-03-02, 4:46:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd expect you'd get a $400 credit at least
[2019-03-02, 4:46:37 PM] Rob Feeny: You'll have to give Jeff and Tana a hug for me
[2019-03-02, 4:46:42 PM] Jamie: I will definitely fight for that.
[2019-03-02, 4:47:04 PM] Jamie: And I have bought just want everything that I can think of including an $80 pair of nice warm sweatpants that I will bill them for
[2019-03-02, 4:47:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha awesome. How many days was that?
[2019-03-02, 4:50:37 PM] Jamie: This would be the 7th day. I’m pretty good at surviving with nothing but it would be nice to have some other pants. I also want to get some of my clothes helmet and I can’t do that till it gets here
[2019-03-02, 4:50:43 PM] Jamie: But it’s OK
[2019-03-02, 4:51:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Craziness
[2019-03-02, 4:53:09 PM] Jamie: Yeah I added up the value at all in it somewhere around four grand.  So I think I’ll just be happy to get it back so I don’t have to spend all the time and re-buying it, as much as it would be nice to get all new gear
[2019-03-02, 4:53:22 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet!
[2019-03-02, 4:53:31 PM] Rob Feeny: And did you get your drone yet?
[2019-03-02, 4:53:50 PM] Jamie: Nope should arrive early next week
[2019-03-02, 4:54:02 PM] Jamie: Somehow I ordered from the slowest supplier on the planet
[2019-03-02, 4:54:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha been a rough time week for you!
[2019-03-02, 4:54:36 PM] Jamie: Are you kidding? I have the best life
[2019-03-02, 4:55:02 PM] Jamie: I’m at MEC right now trying to decide whether not I should buy $125 camping chair
[2019-03-02, 5:05:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha
[2019-03-02, 5:05:14 PM] Rob Feeny: For Ecuador?
[2019-03-02, 5:05:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm eating paletas in San Salvador
‎[2019-03-02, 5:05:38 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-03-02, 5:05:39 PM] Jamie: Yeah. Spend a lot of time sitting on the sand watching surfers
[2019-03-02, 5:05:44 PM] Jamie: Yum!!
[2019-03-02, 5:06:24 PM] Rob Feeny: That works. I know the style. We use them to watch people climb
[2019-03-10, 10:21:07 PM] Jamie: Hey are you around on March 23 and 24th?
[2019-03-10, 10:55:12 PM] Rob Feeny: I should be, coming to Town?
[2019-03-10, 10:55:22 PM] Rob Feeny: The Ps are coming the next weekend
[2019-03-11, 11:29:21 AM] Jamie: Yeah I I am nailing down a plan to be there for that weekend before I fly out
[2019-03-11, 11:32:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok sweet, I've got a spot for you
[2019-03-11, 11:33:21 AM] Jamie: Cool thanks man. I want to see the Tortuga!
[2019-03-11, 11:42:35 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha I'll out you to work on her...
[2019-03-11, 11:42:38 AM] Rob Feeny: *put
[2019-03-14, 2:31:22 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob it looks like I’ll actually be coming in on the 20th at about 9 o’clock at night
[2019-03-14, 2:31:48 PM] Jamie: And any chance I can get a ride to the airport Sunday at about 9 PM?
[2019-03-14, 2:49:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure no prob
[2019-03-14, 2:51:17 PM] Jamie: Appreciate it. I can give you gas money or take you out for beer
[2019-03-14, 2:55:37 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2019-03-14, 2:55:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugh I don't even remember the last time I was sick enough to spend the day in bed
[2019-03-14, 2:56:08 PM] Rob Feeny: But I feel like crap
[2019-03-14, 2:56:10 PM] Jamie: Head cold?
[2019-03-14, 2:56:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah. Cough. Cold. Sore throat. Body pain
[2019-03-14, 3:02:42 PM] Jamie: That sucks. It’s like a parasite that takes over your body, zapping your energy. Hope you get better soon!
[2019-03-14, 3:09:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man. Party cat is in heaven
[2019-03-14, 3:09:58 PM] Jamie: Haha of course. Cuddles all day
[2019-03-14, 3:10:01 PM] Rob Feeny: I've been in bed since 8 yesterday
[2019-03-14, 3:10:46 PM] Jamie: Best place to be. I find if I completely shut down for 2 days, I can usually recover
[2019-03-14, 3:10:50 PM] Rob Feeny: And just to confirm, flying in 20th @ 9, flying out the 24th?
[2019-03-14, 3:11:22 PM] Jamie: I am using Poparide from Kelowna to Vancouver and I think they will drop me at your place
[2019-03-14, 3:11:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh ok perfect
[2019-03-14, 3:11:55 PM] Jamie: And my flight is at 12:20am on the 25th so to the airport for around 9pm on the 24th
[2019-03-14, 3:12:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok that works
[2019-03-14, 3:16:41 PM] Jamie: Cool. Looking forward to seeing ya man
[2019-03-14, 3:57:16 PM] Rob Feeny: You too man :)
[2019-03-14, 4:05:16 PM] Rob Feeny: So are you heading back to Ecuador or to Mexico?
[2019-03-14, 4:08:17 PM] Jamie: Ecuador. I want to get some coding done so I want less vacation, more ritual. And I want to see the shoulder season for weather...
[2019-03-14, 4:08:51 PM] Rob Feeny: No Mexico, poor guy
[2019-03-14, 4:09:06 PM] Jamie: Another year maybe
[2019-03-14, 4:13:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Man a big dose of  cough syrup and some spicy lunch and I'm feeling almost human
[2019-03-15, 1:47:02 PM] Jamie: These pop a ride guys are brutal. 2 cancelled bookings. One guy said he’s not going anymore in a private message but still has his ride posted
[2019-03-15, 1:47:30 PM] Rob Feeny: wtf? I've never had a problem. But I guess I'm driving not riding
[2019-03-15, 1:47:48 PM] Rob Feeny: The nice thing is their reputation drops so in the future they won't get more passengers
[2019-03-15, 1:48:01 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd message the PopaRide guys, they're amazing
[2019-03-15, 1:48:13 PM] Rob Feeny: they'll probably post your ride request for you in all the FB groups and help out
[2019-03-15, 1:48:14 PM] Jamie: The other guy said he doesn’t usually take people with big bags and would let me know the day before. Fair enough but he cancelled my booking today
[2019-03-15, 1:48:38 PM] Rob Feeny: And your bag isn't that big, is it?
[2019-03-15, 1:48:42 PM] Jamie: Well, it looks like there is a bus now. EBus?
[2019-03-15, 1:48:53 PM] Jamie: Yeah it’s a 60L fully loaded
[2019-03-15, 1:48:56 PM] Rob Feeny: I've had people show up with guitars and rollaboards
[2019-03-15, 1:49:01 PM] Rob Feeny: THat's medium luggage ;)
[2019-03-15, 1:49:17 PM] Jamie: I thought so too but he just cancelled my booking.
[2019-03-15, 1:49:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Seriously, that's smaller than most people seem to take when I'm driving
[2019-03-15, 1:49:32 PM] Jamie: Calgary to Kelowna got cancelled last minute too
[2019-03-15, 1:49:50 PM] Jamie: It will work out but I may end up at the bus station downtown Vancouver
[2019-03-15, 1:49:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, definitely complain. I bet they'll give you a credit or just find you a ride
[2019-03-15, 1:50:09 PM] Jamie: Ok I will try that
[2019-03-15, 1:50:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Flo the founder is super nice, I've chatted with him several times
[2019-03-15, 9:59:45 PM] Rob Feeny: You're here Wednesday night right? Got plans for Thursday night?
[2019-03-15, 10:00:04 PM] Jamie: No plans. What’s happening?
[2019-03-15, 10:00:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Was just chatting with Matt Bowman we've been planning to get together
[2019-03-15, 10:00:54 PM] Rob Feeny: I figured you being in town would be a good excuse to have some people together for BBQ and beer
[2019-03-15, 10:01:01 PM] Jamie: Oh cool. I’m down to see those guys
[2019-03-15, 10:02:24 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll sort something out
[2019-03-15, 10:29:16 PM] Rob Feeny: BBQ at my place? Thursday, the Matts should be around with their better halves
[2019-03-15, 10:29:40 PM] Jamie: That sounds awesome! Can I invite a friend?
[2019-03-15, 10:29:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Of course. Invite a bunch
[2019-03-15, 10:30:52 PM] Jamie: Ok it’s Ling. She will probably bail, lol
[2019-03-15, 10:31:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha I figured it was her
[2019-03-15, 10:31:56 PM] Rob Feeny: The nice thing about a BBQ is the plans aren't dependent on any one person
[2019-03-15, 10:34:07 PM] Jamie: It’s true. I’ll invite Gabe too and he will probably bail as well, lol
[2019-03-15, 10:35:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha nice
[2019-03-16, 11:50:26 AM] Jamie: I invited Gabe and Paul, trying to find some girls that will show up but 🤷‍♂️
[2019-03-16, 11:51:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha we'll get Stoja and Mariana over..  😬
[2019-03-16, 11:51:46 AM] Jamie: Maybe the daughter?
[2019-03-16, 11:52:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh Nikolette
[2019-03-16, 11:52:37 AM] Rob Feeny: She needs to be enjoyed while young I think. She's turning into her mom too fast
‎[2019-03-16, 11:53:39 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-03-16, 11:53:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Must be single again, as this is her latest insta haha
[2019-03-16, 11:54:20 AM] Jamie: Yeah you’re probably right. But if I remember correctly, her boobs were on prominent display last time 👍
[2019-03-16, 11:54:58 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm ok with that haha
[2019-03-16, 11:58:16 AM] Jamie: Totally. Any new girls at the Starbucks?
[2019-03-16, 11:58:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm nothing impressive. New one looks good from a distance but when you get close you see the booty hiding behind the counter
[2019-03-16, 11:59:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Got to go to yoga to see the decent ones these days
[2019-03-16, 11:59:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Murphy's law says the drain is backing up a couple days before guests arrive
[2019-03-16, 11:59:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Waiting for the plumber
[2019-03-16, 11:59:55 AM] Jamie: Of course. And when you’re sick
[2019-03-16, 12:00:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugh yah. I feel like death and have so much to do
[2019-03-16, 12:25:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Anybody you don't want invited?
[2019-03-16, 12:26:12 PM] Jamie: Nope. All is welcome
[2019-03-16, 12:26:18 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2019-03-16, 12:26:26 PM] Jamie: Did you mention it to morgan?
[2019-03-16, 12:26:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Even often they don't speakum gud englt?
[2019-03-16, 12:27:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah. He said Melissa gets mad if he's home later than 7 on weeknights. I said we'd drink a beer in honor of the Morgan that once was.
[2019-03-16, 12:30:37 PM] Jamie: ??
[2019-03-16, 12:31:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Autocorrect butchered it but I was bugging you
[2019-03-16, 12:31:40 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm high in DayQuil sorry

[2019-03-16, 12:32:04 PM] Jamie: Ahhh I totally modify my English when I’m in Ecuador.
[2019-03-16, 12:32:05 PM] Rob Feeny: And having a good day
[2019-03-16, 12:32:09 PM] Jamie: Oh gross
[2019-03-16, 12:32:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Thankfully it's just dirty dish water
[2019-03-16, 12:33:50 PM] Jamie: Yeah doesn’t look like dirty dishwater
[2019-03-18, 11:44:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Did you get a ride here sorted?
[2019-03-18, 11:54:06 AM] Jamie: Yup. 2 pm from Kelowna and he says drop at main st sky train. I figure I have a good chance of getting dropped somewhere close by
[2019-03-18, 11:54:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah I'd ask if he could drop you at Sperling/Burnaby Lake station, it's 3 min off the highway and the closest to me
[2019-03-18, 12:08:47 PM] Jamie: Will do. I’ll keep ya posted. Looks like an ok turnout for the bbq
[2019-03-18, 4:23:35 PM] Jamie: Feeling better?
[2019-03-18, 4:27:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes, a lot
[2019-03-18, 4:27:34 PM] Rob Feeny: The sun helps
[2019-03-18, 4:27:36 PM] Rob Feeny: You?
[2019-03-18, 4:28:11 PM] Jamie: Did an 8.5km trail run yesterday. Feel great!
[2019-03-18, 4:28:34 PM] Jamie: Hey who do you bank with? I’m paying $29.95 a month for royal bank!
[2019-03-18, 4:30:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice! We should do a run when you're here
[2019-03-18, 4:30:57 PM] Rob Feeny: I use Tangerine. It's free and I love their site/app but they have no real USD options which I know is big for you
[2019-03-18, 4:31:14 PM] Rob Feeny: But if you want to try it out, I can send you a referral code and we both get $50 if you sign up
[2019-03-18, 4:41:28 PM] Jamie: I’m thinking about the sat morning false creek run. Like 16 people signed up
[2019-03-18, 4:42:18 PM] Jamie: I use an online currency exchange so I only have a US based account that I drop the converted dollars into. No US accounts in Canada
[2019-03-18, 4:43:00 PM] Jamie: Might do that but I need to make a list of what gets pulled out or billed automatically to my visa. Wait does tangerine have visas?
[2019-03-18, 4:43:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I know they have a MasterCard but I don't know about a Visa
[2019-03-18, 4:44:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Does your Visa have to be with the same bank?
[2019-03-18, 4:46:59 PM] Jamie: No. I could keep the visa for the avion points
[2019-03-18, 5:05:39 PM] Jamie: Blah. It’s a lot of work to switch accounts. City of Calgary, insurance, condo fees, mortgage.
[2019-03-18, 5:06:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep but there's an automatic system to do most of it. A migration assistant.
[2019-03-18, 5:06:38 PM] Jamie: Really?
[2019-03-18, 5:06:55 PM] Jamie: How does that work?
[2019-03-18, 5:21:23 PM] Rob Feeny: It goes through your past transactions, I think? I'm not quite sure but it moved 80% of my stuff quite easily
[2019-03-18, 5:29:16 PM] Jamie: Interesting.
[2019-03-19, 11:27:37 AM] Rob Feeny: $80 for a chiropractor hurts but damn they're effective!
[2019-03-19, 11:33:07 AM] Jamie: Ouch. Did you know that if you’re on MSP premium assistance you get something like $25 off each session?
[2019-03-19, 11:33:34 AM] Jamie: I think you can apply for MSP assistance if you’re below $40,000 or something. I remember it being way higher than I expected
[2019-03-19, 11:48:10 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah I used to get that but I'm just over for my last year
[2019-03-19, 11:48:57 AM] Jamie: Dolla, dolla bills y’all
[2019-03-19, 10:30:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey if Paul needs a place to crash Friday night (he's coming through town) would you be open to sharing the living room?
[2019-03-19, 10:39:42 PM] Jamie: 2 person dorm? Luxury
[2019-03-19, 10:40:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha sweet
[2019-03-19, 10:44:01 PM] Jamie: So I’m bringing this guy driving a piece of pie and I figure that’ll probably get me to your front door
[2019-03-19, 10:51:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha sweet
[2019-03-19, 10:51:30 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm working with Morgan's guy tomorrow but I have a key outside for you
[2019-03-19, 10:52:01 PM] Rob Feeny: You can chill with PC
[2019-03-19, 11:18:17 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2019-03-20, 9:39:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Key is under the recycling box, towel is in the living room and there's beer in the fridge
[2019-03-20, 9:58:14 AM] Jamie: Awesome, thanks dude. What time you back tonight?
[2019-03-20, 10:01:49 AM] Rob Feeny: Not quite sure, doing some work for Morgan in Abbotsford but I'm hoping not too kate
[2019-03-20, 10:01:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Latr
[2019-03-20, 10:01:58 AM] Rob Feeny: *late
[2019-03-20, 3:31:04 PM] Jamie: Hey did you want to run on Sat morning?
[2019-03-20, 3:31:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure, I'm in. Then I need to do some work on the truck
[2019-03-20, 6:31:21 PM] Rob Feeny: You on the road?
[2019-03-20, 6:32:14 PM] Jamie: Yup. Maybe 2 hrs out. He’ll drop me at the house
[2019-03-20, 6:40:05 PM] Jamie: I signed us up for False Creek.
[2019-03-20, 7:04:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect thanks
[2019-03-20, 7:04:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm packing up in Abbotsford, home by probably 7
[2019-03-20, 7:05:17 PM] Jamie: 2 hrs from Abbotsford? I hope it doesn’t take me that long, lol. About 20 min past hope
[2019-03-20, 7:05:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Naw, but 20min to pack up, time to drive back to my car then drive home
[2019-03-20, 7:06:20 PM] Jamie: Ahhh that’s what I figured
[2019-03-20, 7:06:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Plus Morgan factor
[2019-03-20, 7:06:43 PM] Jamie: Lol. How’s his eye today?
[2019-03-20, 7:14:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm not working with him today, just for him, but I figure not still applies
[2019-03-20, 8:32:14 PM] Jamie: About 15 min away
[2019-03-20, 8:35:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'm about 30
[2019-03-20, 11:59:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Don't forget that those lights will kick on at about 540am unless you shut them off..
[2019-03-21, 12:00:10 AM] Rob Feeny: And I apologise in advance if my coughing keeps you up
[2019-03-21, 12:03:14 AM] Jamie: All good
[2019-03-21, 6:26:35 PM] Jamie: Hey do you have a key for Dan and Janices so that Alex can get in there to stuff her face?
[2019-03-21, 6:29:46 PM] Jamie: And I got charcoal
[2019-03-21, 6:29:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome. And yes
[2019-03-21, 6:30:11 PM] Rob Feeny: On the dryer, there's a skinny lanyward of keys
[2019-03-21, 6:30:16 PM] Rob Feeny: One is for his house
[2019-03-21, 6:30:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll be home in like 20min
[2019-03-21, 6:30:40 PM] Jamie: Got it

[2019-03-22, 5:19:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yeah it's complicated
[2019-03-22, 7:12:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Wait til you take a train from the airport and they add $5 to the fare
[2019-03-22, 7:12:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Just bought something I've wanted forever

[2019-03-25, 1:56:18 PM] Jamie: In Panama
[2019-03-25, 1:56:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah damn, what happened?
[2019-03-25, 1:58:18 PM] Jamie: It’s one my layovers. Mexico City, Panama City, Guayaquil. Just praying that my backpack makes it here, ha ha
[2019-03-25, 1:58:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh, I miscounted hours. Haha.
[2019-03-25, 2:01:17 PM] Jamie: So the lady and Vancouver told me I had to pick up my luggage in Panama so I went all the way through to the baggage area and they tell me my bag is going to be direct in Guayaquil. Air travel is so bad.
[2019-03-25, 2:02:39 PM] Rob Feeny: It truly is. Coming back from El Salvador, 50% of the time I was told to grab my back in Houston, 50% that it would be checked through
[2019-03-25, 2:03:54 PM] Jamie: Super annoying to have to go through all the security etc here when I didn’t have to. But it’s a 5 hrs layover
[2019-03-25, 2:10:41 PM] Jamie: Wow. That was fast. I’m sitting at the gate, lol
[2019-03-25, 2:16:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Nicr
[2019-03-25, 2:16:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice
[2019-03-25, 9:37:27 PM] Jamie: Made it. Bag and all. Except that immigration believed that I actually only was in Ecuador last time for three days instead of only having three days left so they stamped me for 87 days, ha ha. My only worry is that I’ll get caught on the way out and they will read it differently
[2019-03-25, 11:27:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha Well, I think the Latin thing is that you deal with it then...
[2019-03-25, 11:27:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Did they speak to you in English or Spanish?
[2019-03-25, 11:28:04 PM] Rob Feeny: You could simply claim you misunderstood due to language and just assumed they knew the law better than you
[2019-03-26, 9:02:16 AM] Jamie: We tried Spanish first, then English. I could have argued and showed them my passport but ... 🤷‍♂️
[2019-03-26, 9:04:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha not your problem. And now no extension needed

[2019-03-26, 4:46:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Very cool!
[2019-03-26, 4:48:07 PM] Jamie: I thought so. For some reason, the video I have from you looks different. Once I have Internet back I’ll move it to my computer and check to see what the quality is
[2019-03-26, 4:48:18 PM] Jamie: But for my first real edit, I’m happy
[2019-03-26, 4:49:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, maybe I can change a setting or send it a different way next time
[2019-03-26, 10:36:22 PM] Jamie: I had no idea these were a thing.

[2019-03-26, 10:55:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah did you see the red one in my glove box? Ben's daughter made it for me.
[2019-03-26, 10:55:54 PM] Jamie: No I didn’t. Seems like a cool idea but all they ones I saw were so cheap. And bulky
[2019-03-26, 10:56:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah that's why I don't like them
[2019-03-26, 10:56:17 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't wear it but I couldn't turn it down!
[2019-03-26, 10:56:36 PM] Jamie: Of course. Handy in the glove box
[2019-03-26, 10:56:44 PM] Rob Feeny: One of those jeeps on sunday they had holyshit handles made from paracord that would do the same thing I guess

[2019-03-27, 2:04:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm strange
[2019-03-27, 2:04:51 PM] Jamie: I’m learning about it right now. Video editing is much more complicated than I thought!

[2019-04-04, 9:28:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey is there any way to use a tone generator to tone a single conductor wire?
[2019-04-04, 9:45:06 PM] Jamie: Not really. The only way that I’ve done it before was to run the second wire. So I took a ground out of a loomex and ran it from one side of the wire I was trying to tone to the other
[2019-04-04, 9:45:11 PM] Jamie: What’s the situation?
[2019-04-04, 9:46:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Trying to help a friend with automotive troubleshooting on his crazy foreign 4x4
[2019-04-04, 9:46:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Trying to find out where wires go
[2019-04-04, 9:46:41 PM] Jamie: Well for automotive can’t you always use the chassis as the ground wire?
[2019-04-04, 9:46:55 PM] Jamie: Yeah that might not work though because then everything will time
[2019-04-04, 9:47:02 PM] Jamie: tone*
[2019-04-04, 9:47:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Exactly what I was thinking
[2019-04-04, 9:47:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok just thought maybe there was some trick
[2019-04-04, 9:47:51 PM] Jamie: The trick is to apply voltage lol.
[2019-04-04, 9:48:19 PM] Rob Feeny: True but then you need to disconnect the other end or cut the insulation
[2019-04-04, 9:48:20 PM] Jamie: Remove all other sources of power and  then apply voltage to the wire
[2019-04-04, 9:48:44 PM] Jamie: Are you mapping it or looking for something specific?
[2019-04-04, 9:49:19 PM] Rob Feeny: He's trying to trace the wires to the 4wd mechanism and they'll all the same damn color
[2019-04-04, 9:49:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, there are a lot that are the same color
[2019-04-04, 9:50:24 PM] Jamie: Yeah sounds complicated with no simple way. Other than to disconnect both ends and run voltage
[2019-04-04, 10:01:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugly. Ok thanks man

[2019-04-06, 6:29:02 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll probably sell it within a year and make a profit

[2019-04-08, 7:40:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Only 25hrs of paid work but a productive week. This doesn't show the 7 hours I otut in yesterday on the yard/garden or the 3 on the Van. Saturday was also van/running around getting house/housetruck/work materials and dealing with the van. A good work/life balance
[2019-04-08, 8:02:23 AM] Jamie: Nice!

[2019-04-08, 9:38:00 AM] Rob Feeny: I figure 8.5hrs of video editing teaches you some tricks
‎[2019-04-08, 9:42:37 AM] Jamie: ‎video omitted
[2019-04-08, 9:46:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha awesome! Did that guy at the end finger the camera?
[2019-04-08, 9:46:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Those waves look so much easier to learn on than El Salvador
[2019-04-08, 10:19:11 AM] Jamie: He gave the 🤙🏻
[2019-04-12, 9:09:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Jamie, I've got something to discuss with you. Kat Brine and I have a very overlapping friends group (and I went on dates for a while with a good friend of hers). We're friends now but I always feel slightly awkward about it due to your past relationship with her. She recently asked for help building something and I helped her build a bed in the back of her Subaru for her and her girlfriend. I went to go post it on social media and realized I was uncomfortable doing that because I didn't want to anger you. Rather than feel uncomfortable about it, I figured I'd message you and just sort it out.
[2019-04-12, 9:10:22 AM] Rob Feeny: It's a purely platonic friendship, she's engaged to a lovely girl but we share a lot of outdoors friends
[2019-04-12, 9:11:37 AM] Jamie: It’s all good man. Not gonna anger me. In fact, happy to hear she figured out what she wanted
[2019-04-12, 9:12:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Thanks. Yah she seems to have gotten over dating shitty guys. Rachel her partner is head over heels and treats her very well
[2019-04-12, 9:12:34 AM] Rob Feeny: *Rachelle
[2019-04-12, 9:13:02 AM] Jamie: Very cool. Thanks for saying something though
‎[2019-04-15, 9:48:37 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-04-15, 9:49:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice!
[2019-04-15, 9:49:49 AM] Rob Feeny: I need to update mine. The question is, do I call the camper a business project and log the 20hrs I spent on it this weekend?
‎[2019-04-15, 9:51:27 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
‎[2019-04-15, 9:51:30 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-04-15, 9:51:50 AM] Rob Feeny: The scary part is, only 10hrs of that was billable but I worked about 45hrs
[2019-04-15, 9:54:16 AM] Rob Feeny: And did you find a system to store large files? I used Google Drive in El Salvador because it synced over time. Large file transfers were a PITA with bad internet (1gbps) so I basically would start them and it would complete over a few hours/days)
[2019-04-15, 10:02:16 AM] Jamie: Who says you only have to track business stuff?
[2019-04-15, 10:02:36 AM] Jamie: I’m tempted to track surfing too just cuz I love tracking stuff
[2019-04-15, 10:02:57 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm True. I guess I was more working on the idea that what I wanted to track/increase is time spent on money-making activities
[2019-04-15, 10:03:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Or net worth increasing
[2019-04-15, 10:04:02 AM] Jamie: Yeah the iCloud Drive works pretty good. I can send someone a link but it shows to them like they are going have to log in to iCloud in the link but then there is a button to direct download. And it’s free and links to all my other apps
[2019-04-15, 10:06:01 AM] Jamie: How’s that going?
[2019-04-15, 10:06:33 AM] Rob Feeny: Well, not amazingly well, but I'm quite productive in general lately and happier
[2019-04-15, 10:07:01 AM] Jamie: Because of the 15k ish on the vans?
[2019-04-15, 10:07:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Solid progress on the big truck/shop and the camper looks way better. Home renos don't help with net worth but they help with my happiness and self confidence
[2019-04-15, 10:07:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Well, honestly both were bought below market value so the purchases increased my net worth
[2019-04-15, 10:07:58 AM] Rob Feeny: That camper should have been 10k
[2019-04-15, 10:08:29 AM] Jamie: Very true. How about 2 projects in Toggl? One for happiness related projects and one for income related projects?
[2019-04-15, 10:08:30 AM] Rob Feeny: And I've sold over $600 worth of stuff out of the big truck and it's still probably worth 10k if you include all the parts I could sell
[2019-04-15, 10:08:41 AM] Jamie: Then your graph would show the relationship
[2019-04-15, 10:08:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm true
[2019-04-15, 10:09:00 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll tinker with it
[2019-04-15, 10:09:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Generally, I think if the hours worked are increasing I'm fairly satisfied, as long as I have sufficient cash flow
[2019-04-15, 10:09:50 AM] Rob Feeny: And I just accepted a 3 week job that will get me 40+ hrs a week until I leave
[2019-04-15, 10:09:59 AM] Jamie: Nice!
‎[2019-04-15, 10:10:30 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-04-15, 10:11:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm no, what program is that?
[2019-04-15, 10:12:04 AM] Jamie: That’s google sheets. I moved my rental income spreadsheet from Numbers to Sheets this year and populated this from almost 10 years of data
[2019-04-15, 10:12:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow
[2019-04-15, 10:12:36 AM] Rob Feeny: I've never used the graphing in sheets
[2019-04-15, 10:12:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Looks good
[2019-04-15, 10:13:48 AM] Jamie: It’s nice to see that even after the 10k reno I am up around $16k in rental income over 10 years
[2019-04-15, 10:18:47 AM] Jamie: Isn’t tracking fun? Lol
[2019-04-15, 10:23:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha it totally is
[2019-04-15, 10:24:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Any gain on the value of the condo?
[2019-04-15, 10:24:34 AM] Jamie: Nada. Probably less than purchase price these days
[2019-04-15, 10:25:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Part of my thinking for my projects is that even if I'm making $5 a hour on them, I'm working more than I usually do so any gain is worth it and they make me happier than working
[2019-04-15, 10:25:24 AM] Rob Feeny: That's tough
[2019-04-16, 8:47:04 AM] Jamie: Hey what’s the cheapest place to buy a domain name?
[2019-04-16, 8:57:49 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm they're all pretty close, within a buck or two. Lots offer a first year discount but make sure it doesn't jump up the second year
[2019-04-16, 8:58:13 AM] Rob Feeny: I use Namespro.ca because they're in Vancouver and their customer service is very responsive
[2019-04-16, 8:58:28 AM] Jamie: Yeah go daddy is .99, 9.99 and then 17.95. Host gator is about 12.85
[2019-04-16, 8:58:48 AM] Jamie: Ok will check it out. I want to buy www.iphoneandadrone.com
[2019-04-16, 8:58:58 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha nice
[2019-04-16, 8:59:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Going to do some web design too?
[2019-04-16, 9:00:13 AM] Jamie: Just my own. I want to learn about affiliate payments through amazon.
[2019-04-16, 9:00:58 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice. I've dabbled a bit but haven't really gotten into it
[2019-04-16, 9:01:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Wanted to do it for Tiny House stuff
[2019-04-16, 9:01:58 AM] Jamie: Well if I get this grant, I will be taking the web dev bootcamp. Morgan, you, me and every little surf shop in Ecuador needs a website, lol
[2019-04-16, 9:02:35 AM] Jamie: But tiny houses are a good niche with hard to source items and knowledge. It’s honestly perfect for making money off a website.
[2019-04-17, 1:29:18 PM] Jamie: Got a second?
[2019-04-17, 1:29:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure
‎[2019-04-17, 1:29:34 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-04-17, 1:29:55 PM] Jamie: Can I call? Just needs a little advice on the job grant app
[2019-04-17, 1:30:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2019-04-18, 3:37:37 PM] Jamie: I waaaaaant

[2019-04-22, 9:27:12 AM] Jamie: A solid week
[2019-04-22, 9:27:48 AM] Rob Feeny: I should have out the time spent working on the camper in. It'd out me at like 60hrs
[2019-04-22, 9:27:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Put me
[2019-04-22, 9:28:03 AM] Rob Feeny: You're being consistent
[2019-04-22, 9:29:17 AM] Jamie: Yeah I’m happy with the time I’m getting into the app. It’s mentally tough to chip away at when everything you do is brand new and has to be learned through google first
[2019-04-22, 9:30:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha yup. You need to find some community. Maybe a Reddit channel? People doing the same thing as you
[2019-04-22, 9:32:44 AM] Jamie: True. I guess right now the responsibility for figuring it out is on me. The moment I start posting looking for answers, I transfer that responsibility and hope someone solves it for me. I haven’t got stuck yet, it’s just slow and painful. But my depth of learning is more this way, I feel
[2019-04-22, 9:34:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm yes I get that, but also having someone to ask questions is a huge help, especially when it comes to comprehension. And it's good way to learn what tools work best
[2019-04-22, 9:34:53 AM] Jamie: Yeah live help would be nice. I’m looking forward to the coworking space at lighthouse labs when I’m back in Vancouver for that reason
[2019-04-28, 9:01:25 AM] Jamie: Hey man. Anything you might want to borrow from my camping stuff stored in Vancouver is fair game. Anything you need?
[2019-04-28, 9:03:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Naw I think I've got all the goodies I need tbh
[2019-04-28, 9:03:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Is it all at Fairmont?
[2019-04-28, 9:03:25 AM] Jamie: I figured
[2019-04-28, 9:03:30 AM] Jamie: Nope at Georgia
[2019-04-28, 9:03:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh nice, easier for you than in Kelowna?
[2019-04-28, 9:04:29 AM] Jamie: Well Morgan moved while I was in Ecuador so to Georgia it went. I need to get it out of there though
[2019-04-28, 9:07:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah it doesn't seem like a safe space
‎[2019-04-29, 9:28:30 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-04-29, 10:02:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice, is that paid work?
[2019-04-29, 10:18:40 AM] Jamie: Bartering work. He owns the hostel I stay at in Guayaquil do I got lunch, dinner and free nights.
[2019-04-29, 10:20:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Sweet. It gets your name out there too
[2019-04-29, 10:28:25 AM] Jamie: Yeah and it was fun
[2019-04-29, 10:29:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Very cool
[2019-04-29, 10:29:19 AM] Rob Feeny: I should have been tracking the work on the camper
[2019-04-29, 10:29:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Just ordered a new hot water heater for it
‎[2019-04-29, 10:30:24 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-04-29, 10:30:33 AM] Rob Feeny: Plus maybe 16hrs on the camper!
[2019-04-29, 10:32:02 AM] Jamie: You sent mine back, lol
[2019-04-29, 10:32:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh shit haha

[2019-04-29, 10:33:56 AM] Jamie: Looks like mostly paid work!
[2019-04-29, 1:28:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup it was a good but exhausting work
[2019-04-29, 1:29:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Just confirmed I can't put a hitch anywhere on my van for less than 2k
[2019-04-29, 2:14:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey what's that app you use to track fuel economy
[2019-04-29, 2:36:48 PM] Jamie: Was that the plan?
[2019-04-29, 2:37:06 PM] Jamie: Haven’t used it years, can’t remember
[2019-04-29, 2:37:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes I was going to bring the small bike along with me

[2019-05-03, 7:30:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Just wired up the hot water heater for AC & DC
[2019-05-03, 7:30:29 PM] Jamie: Very nice! I dub thee Sir Sparky

[2019-05-03, 7:34:46 PM] Jamie: Yikes. How much was the water heater?
[2019-05-03, 7:36:41 PM] Rob Feeny: $70p :S
[2019-05-03, 7:36:45 PM] Rob Feeny: *700
[2019-05-03, 7:36:56 PM] Rob Feeny: But I might have the camper rented for all of June which will pay for it
[2019-05-03, 7:37:24 PM] Jamie: Wow. Nice work. Can’t wait to see that thing. When do you leave?
[2019-05-03, 7:43:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Sunday. Yeeps. So much to do.
[2019-05-03, 7:52:36 PM] Jamie: I bet
[2019-05-03, 7:52:49 PM] Jamie: You taking party cat?
[2019-05-03, 7:54:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep! It'll be interesting!
[2019-05-03, 7:56:07 PM] Jamie: Haha I’m sure it will be fine
[2019-05-03, 7:56:54 PM] Rob Feeny: She's coming out and exploring it while I'm working on it too
[2019-05-03, 8:01:52 PM] Jamie: Ahh I think you will be happy have here. Got a spot for the litter box or will she go outside?
[2019-05-03, 8:06:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Under the couch, it just fits. Not a lot of space though for storage! That was where some things were stored
[2019-05-04, 3:32:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, I managed to install it without killing myself 👍🏻

[2019-05-04, 4:13:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha that's their version of almond ?!
[2019-05-04, 4:13:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Definitely doesn't match the almond of my rig
[2019-05-04, 5:37:07 PM] Jamie: Funny died in the electrical world we had Allmond and light Allmond
[2019-05-04, 5:37:49 PM] Jamie: in*
[2019-05-05, 1:44:53 PM] Rob Feeny: There was just a shooting beside Kensington plaza
[2019-05-05, 1:45:06 PM] Rob Feeny: I heard it! Now Dan says there are about 10 police cars there
[2019-05-05, 1:55:38 PM] Jamie: Holy shit
[2019-05-05, 1:55:49 PM] Jamie: Check scanner sites maybe?
[2019-05-05, 1:56:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Too busy packing! I'll get the updates
[2019-05-05, 7:01:21 PM] Jamie: Ahh I get so frustrated sometimes. My headspace is so good until I meet a girl that I would like to know a little better. And when there is no real interest shown but then she gets together with a local, it hurts. I mean she is interested in something, just not with me.
[2019-05-05, 7:05:14 PM] Jamie: I watched a girl that I had chatted with for a bit walk into the coffee shop, take one look at the Aussie working there and she started showing obvious signs that she was interested. He slept with her the next day.  So girls can communicate interest when they want something but it’s been so long since I felt that.

[2019-05-08, 2:13:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn, $521 flights to Quito in Sept & Oct

[2019-05-08, 2:22:03 PM] Jamie: The only way I can change that is to not go one year or change the type of visa
[2019-05-08, 2:23:21 PM] Rob Feeny: And when do you leave this time?
[2019-05-08, 2:23:39 PM] Jamie: June 16th back to Vancouver
[2019-05-08, 2:25:49 PM] Jamie: You in Lumby yet?
[2019-05-08, 2:29:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope, tomorrow, at the mechanic, been having a bit of mechanical trouble
[2019-05-08, 2:29:19 PM] Jamie: What’s happening?
[2019-05-08, 2:40:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Just diagnosed the electrical problems, it's an AC thing, I didn't make the connection but it wouldn't start with the AC turned on
[2019-05-08, 3:54:13 PM] Jamie: Ahh well that’s not so bad
[2019-05-08, 5:24:36 PM] Jamie: Hey just watched a sci-fi movie called the wander earth. Chinese but dubbed pretty good. It was awesome. You should watch it on Netflix
[2019-05-08, 5:25:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I've been hearing about it, was looking at downloading it.
[2019-05-08, 5:25:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Now I'll for download it for sure
[2019-05-08, 5:25:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Where'd you find it?

[2019-05-20, 6:56:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes and choppy
[2019-05-20, 6:56:51 PM] Jamie: Well I hope you ate sitting back for a birthday beer with party cat in your lap soon
[2019-05-20, 6:57:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yup and BBQing
[2019-05-20, 6:58:20 PM] Jamie: Very nice man. Enjoy! I’m off for dinner.
[2019-05-26, 8:43:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Did you feel the big earthquake in Peru?
[2019-05-26, 8:53:01 AM] Jamie: Yes I did actually. It was one of those ones that wake you up but can’t quite tell if it was an earthquake or you are just disoriented. Enough though that I packed a bag with water and food and left it by the door
[2019-05-26, 8:53:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha smart man
[2019-05-26, 8:53:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Freaky experience
[2019-05-26, 8:53:51 AM] Jamie: It is. The worst part of trying to go back to sleep while your mind classifies any movement / noise as the aftershock 😬
[2019-05-26, 8:54:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha yup. Graz didn't get it. She just ignored them
[2019-05-26, 8:54:43 AM] Jamie: In Guayaquil there was a big one and I ran out of the building and realized I had left everything in there. Had I not been able to get back in, I was fucked for survival
[2019-05-26, 8:54:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Need a bug-out bag
‎[2019-05-26, 8:55:08 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-05-26, 8:55:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Remember that pot?
[2019-05-26, 8:55:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Bought a set for the camper from thrift store
[2019-05-26, 8:55:38 AM] Jamie: Even worse on the coast. If the electricity / water supply is damaged, in a day we would all be hundreds of miles from help
[2019-05-26, 8:55:54 AM] Jamie: Looks familiar!
[2019-05-26, 8:56:54 AM] Jamie: Weather looking up!
[2019-05-26, 8:56:59 AM] Jamie: *?
[2019-05-26, 8:57:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Ish
[2019-05-26, 8:57:49 AM] Rob Feeny: Just delayed to 8 today, I have 4 days to get 11 flights :S
[2019-05-26, 8:58:09 AM] Rob Feeny: At least you're in a society of people that are used to doing without
[2019-05-26, 9:03:36 AM] Jamie: And lots of dogs to eat!
[2019-05-26, 9:04:17 AM] Rob Feeny: lol. Start with the chickens maybe?
[2019-05-26, 9:04:33 AM] Rob Feeny: But true, you'll be competing with the dogs for meat so maybe start with them
‎[2019-05-27, 11:55:25 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-05-27, 11:55:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Did a bit.   Plus loads of flying
[2019-05-27, 12:06:41 PM] Jamie: Nice. I didn’t even track what I did. About the same. Struggling a little mentally
[2019-05-27, 12:08:09 PM] Rob Feeny: In a rut?
[2019-05-27, 12:08:51 PM] Jamie: Yeah a little bored and not having much luck with women
[2019-05-27, 12:10:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha the root of all evil
[2019-05-27, 12:11:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Is it even realistic to find anything meaningful there?
[2019-05-27, 12:14:13 PM] Jamie: Probably not. But watching other people have flings is tough too. I see a woman I find attractive and she is always interested in someone else. I might surf with her and go out for food with her but in the end, it’s always a local guy that sleeps with them.
[2019-05-27, 12:14:31 PM] Jamie: It’s like that’s the go to vacation fantasy here. Local boyfriend.
[2019-05-27, 12:15:05 PM] Rob Feeny: I get it. It's part of the experience.. there are Canadians everywhere
[2019-05-27, 12:16:35 PM] Jamie: Yup. A couple of big hits to the ego in the last couple weeks with that sort of thing. The worst is going out for drinks and having the girl you invited spend the whole time talking to another guy, haha
[2019-05-27, 12:17:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yup, but them being shitty and selfish is no statement about you as a person
[2019-05-27, 12:19:04 PM] Jamie: Very true. And I can walk away with my pride but they walk away with a girl for the night
[2019-05-27, 12:20:05 PM] Jamie: I felt like in Vancouver the guy that the girls went after was a certain type. I’m learning it’s the same here. And I am not that type
[2019-05-27, 12:21:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Indeed.
[2019-05-27, 12:21:14 PM] Rob Feeny: And can't be that type, as you're not a local
[2019-05-27, 12:24:25 PM] Rob Feeny: What about local girls?
[2019-05-27, 12:32:40 PM] Jamie: There are a few attractive girls but not many.
[2019-05-27, 12:32:45 PM] Jamie: Locals I mean
[2019-05-27, 1:04:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I'm not surprised. How much longer do you have there?
[2019-05-27, 1:04:49 PM] Rob Feeny: And have you thought about how the locals do better because they're more aggressive?
[2019-05-27, 1:05:32 PM] Jamie: About 3 weeks. It’s way better in high season, enough women for everyone
[2019-05-27, 1:37:12 PM] Rob Feeny: When's high season?
[2019-05-27, 2:31:52 PM] Jamie: Mid December - mid April
[2019-05-30, 1:04:01 PM] Rob Feeny: I swear I see more gorgeous women in 2 hours on Bernard that a week in Vancouver
[2019-05-30, 1:06:52 PM] Jamie: Yeah it’s a great place for people watching. How long you in Kelowna for?
[2019-05-30, 1:20:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Leaving at 3pm
[2019-05-30, 6:46:23 PM] Jamie: Have a good drive
[2019-05-30, 6:46:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha wellllll the van broke down. Haven't gone anywhere
[2019-05-30, 6:47:03 PM] Jamie: What? What happenwe?
[2019-05-30, 6:48:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Not 100% sure at the moment. We thought it was the fuel pump. Was planning on taking it into the shop tonight because it won't stay running. Then I figured out that the fridge had gotten flipped to DC not Gas and now I'm thinking it might have be overloading the alternator and not leaving enough juice for the fuel pump
[2019-05-30, 6:49:44 PM] Jamie: So should be able to boost it then?
[2019-05-30, 6:50:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Well it's more that it wouldn't stay running and was running like crap
[2019-05-30, 6:51:03 PM] Rob Feeny: But it's electronic fuel injection, low voltage could have been screwing with the system. I've got the fridge off and I'm letting the solar charge up the camper batteries while I run the van to charge the van battery
[2019-05-30, 6:51:23 PM] Jamie: Do you have to be anywhere tomorrow?
[2019-05-30, 6:51:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Well I had 3 passengers lined up that I cancelled on last minute 😭
[2019-05-30, 6:52:05 PM] Rob Feeny: And yes tomorrow night is the start of the Small Home Expo that I'm teaching at
[2019-05-30, 6:52:40 PM] Jamie: Ahhh all around shitty deal!! Will your passengers take a ride tomorrow?
[2019-05-30, 6:53:11 PM] Rob Feeny: One already booked a ride tonight, I fully cancelled because I didn't know when it would be fixed
[2019-05-30, 6:57:29 PM] Jamie: Ok I hope it works out quickly for ya. I’m excited to be back in Van in less than 3 weeks
[2019-05-30, 7:01:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah? Registered for your course?
[2019-05-30, 7:05:54 PM] Jamie: Didn’t get the grant because I didn’t renew my business license. 🙁
[2019-05-30, 7:06:25 PM] Jamie: so I’m just going to work on coding and whatever else I feel like doing. Having fun with the video editing.
[2019-05-31, 12:11:42 PM] Jamie: Get your van working?
[2019-05-31, 12:13:51 PM] Rob Feeny: It's on the lift right now, they're dropping the tank
[2019-06-02, 9:32:15 AM] Jamie: So were you happy with your birthday month?
[2019-06-02, 9:48:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha yes indeed man, it's was a great one
[2019-06-02, 10:13:20 AM] Jamie: Happy to hear Rob. Any video or photos?
‎[2019-06-02, 10:17:24 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-02, 10:17:42 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll have some to share, just doing breakfast!
[2019-06-02, 1:25:46 PM] Jamie: Very cool. Tailgate party!
[2019-06-02, 2:53:49 PM] Rob Feeny: We're at the Small Home Expo in Abbotsford, Ben and some others organized it
[2019-06-03, 5:03:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh god is Brooke hot now. Jeezus
[2019-06-03, 5:03:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Sitting with her at Starbucks, she's in an amazing skirt
[2019-06-03, 5:03:25 PM] Jamie: No kidding! Just fucking beautiful
[2019-06-03, 5:04:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Very distracting
[2019-06-03, 5:05:02 PM] Rob Feeny: And she doesn't want to do her work, just chat
[2019-06-03, 5:06:35 PM] Jamie: Tell her I say hi!
[2019-06-03, 5:08:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Will do, she's off to the store
[2019-06-04, 6:57:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Just bought another bike. I've got a problem. Haha
[2019-06-04, 6:57:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Another CM250
[2019-06-04, 6:57:53 PM] Rob Feeny: But the 450 is for sale
[2019-06-04, 6:58:16 PM] Jamie: Haha between your travelling houses and motorcycles, you have like 6 vehicles!
[2019-06-04, 6:58:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Up to 6!
[2019-06-04, 6:58:52 PM] Rob Feeny: One will go away soon
[2019-06-04, 6:59:01 PM] Rob Feeny: But they're all cheap
[2019-06-04, 6:59:49 PM] Rob Feeny: All 6 together are worth 24k
[2019-06-04, 7:00:51 PM] Rob Feeny: The one I bought today was 600, came with 2 helmets, a joe rocket jacket and a charger
[2019-06-04, 7:01:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Crazy crazy cheap
[2019-06-04, 7:27:27 PM] Jamie: That’s money in the bank eventually. Right? If you piece it out?
[2019-06-04, 7:28:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Every single one has been purchased for a a price decently below actual value
[2019-06-04, 7:29:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Morgan still owes me eight thousand and there's not much work right now so I'm going to go on a selling spree
[2019-06-04, 7:30:06 PM] Jamie: Is he working?
[2019-06-04, 7:32:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Doesn't sound like he's doing much at all. But he's still supporting 2 mistresses, a wife and 2 kids
[2019-06-04, 7:34:15 PM] Jamie: Yikes
[2019-06-04, 7:42:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah things better shape up soon or I'm taking my money in tools and materials
[2019-06-04, 8:16:40 PM] Jamie: Or mistress’s?
[2019-06-04, 8:17:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaba already tried that, offered to take one for a weekend as interest
[2019-06-05, 11:13:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Got some keys of yours from Darren in the mail, I'll put them in your files
[2019-06-06, 7:52:37 AM] Jamie: Thx dude
[2019-06-06, 3:04:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmmm just did a screening test for ADHD at the doctor's. They're sending me to see a specialist...
[2019-06-06, 3:07:56 PM] Jamie: Interesting. What made you go to the doctor? Last nights anxiety?
[2019-06-06, 3:11:07 PM] Rob Feeny: No. It's been building a while. It was an add-on as I went for routine STD testing and just asked while I was there
[2019-06-06, 3:12:04 PM] Rob Feeny: My roommate has it and we've talked about it
[2019-06-06, 3:12:49 PM] Jamie: Well I hope that something in there might help. Would you take ADHD meds?
[2019-06-06, 3:14:49 PM] Rob Feeny: The test was eerie, it was like reading a description of my childhood
[2019-06-06, 3:15:17 PM] Rob Feeny: I might try them but, like with depression, I'd rather use a diagnosis to research other options and root causes
[2019-06-06, 3:16:46 PM] Jamie: Makes sense. Do you think it is linked to your depression?
[2019-06-06, 3:17:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I'm not sure, tbh, hence the desire to see a professional
[2019-06-06, 3:17:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe there's some microbiome based connection too?
[2019-06-06, 3:18:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha just read a very interesting report on how titanium dioxide, a food additive that used to be considered safe, screws up your stomach lining and microbiome, which they never caught in their initial testing when it was introduced 60yrs ago
[2019-06-06, 3:18:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Lots of stuff coming up like that these days, maybe something is messing with my head
[2019-06-06, 3:21:27 PM] Jamie: Yeah what I ingest is a huge part of my happiness. Too much alcohol and my mood drops. Shitty food and I feel like crap
[2019-06-06, 3:26:55 PM] Jamie: Well I hope you learn some more info that helps you dude
[2019-06-06, 3:27:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Indeed. It makes you think, maybe in the past, cabin fever, winter depression etc were also tied to the changed diet
[2019-06-06, 3:27:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man
[2019-06-06, 3:28:54 PM] Jamie: I was thinking about crashing a couple nights at your place if that’s cool. Probably the 17th and 18th if June?
[2019-06-06, 3:29:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure no prob
[2019-06-06, 3:29:21 PM] Rob Feeny: If the van is around you can crash there too
[2019-06-06, 3:53:17 PM] Jamie: Cool. I’d be happy to sleep in the van
[2019-06-06, 3:54:13 PM] Jamie: Just found out I can renew my FSR and contractors license without having to do anything special even though I let it expire last year. I was worried I would have to write the exam (6 hrs!) again
[2019-06-06, 3:54:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. Planning on doing some electrical while you're here?
[2019-06-06, 3:55:55 PM] Jamie: It’s pretty good money. Would be nice to get some income and being able to pull my own permits is valuable
[2019-06-06, 6:18:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Just cut my inbox from 18p emails to 18. #feelsgoodman
[2019-06-06, 6:29:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Oops, 180 to 18
[2019-06-06, 6:30:55 PM] Jamie: Bet that feels good
[2019-06-06, 6:33:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn good. I'm stressed but things are slowly going back to normal. That month off was a lot
[2019-06-06, 7:05:13 PM] Jamie: Yeah a month off makes you feel like you missed a bunch, right?
[2019-06-07, 4:06:32 PM] Rob Feeny: So, from my understanding, I should be able to convert this AC LED light string to DC right?
‎[2019-06-07, 4:06:41 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-07, 4:07:04 PM] Rob Feeny: There's no converter built in and they have that high frequency AC flicker that you only notice when you move your head
[2019-06-07, 4:11:12 PM] Jamie: I don’t think so
[2019-06-07, 4:13:07 PM] Jamie: It’s still 120v. If you give it 12v dc then it will be very dim (10%) and there must be something converting the AC to DC somewhere. Perhaps in each LED. But these products no longer work on the same principles I know.
[2019-06-07, 4:13:35 PM] Jamie: They have so many electronics jammed inside, they are hard to understand
[2019-06-07, 4:14:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Well the interesting thing is that there seems to be zero circuitry anywhere in this system, just a fuse
[2019-06-07, 4:14:46 PM] Rob Feeny: From what I understand, LEDs work on AC just like a light bulb, lighting up and going out at the polarity flips, 60hz a second
[2019-06-07, 4:14:50 PM] Rob Feeny: *as
[2019-06-07, 4:15:20 PM] Rob Feeny: I have a variable DC power supply, and a spare set of those patio lights, might do some tinkering!
[2019-06-07, 4:16:07 PM] Rob Feeny: BTW got my "whole home distributed audio" system sorted through Chromecast Audios 🤣
[2019-06-07, 4:16:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Ghetto but functional
[2019-06-07, 4:16:30 PM] Jamie: And even proper volume control?
[2019-06-07, 4:16:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Through my phone
[2019-06-07, 4:16:52 PM] Rob Feeny: 3 zones controlled through the Google home app
[2019-06-07, 4:16:58 PM] Jamie: Wasn’t there a problem with the sound bar?
[2019-06-07, 4:18:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah endless problems, it sucks, but I can control line level input via the Chromecast
[2019-06-07, 4:18:30 PM] Jamie: Ah ok. So 2 other zones are bathroom and bedroom?
[2019-06-07, 4:18:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Technically I should be able to control the HEOS through my phone but it won't connect to my 5ghz network
[2019-06-07, 4:18:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Kitchen and back yard
[2019-06-07, 4:19:05 PM] Jamie: How did you do the back yard?
[2019-06-07, 4:19:24 PM] Rob Feeny: A tiny amp off AliExpress and some speakers a client gave to me
[2019-06-07, 4:19:41 PM] Rob Feeny: That's just mocked up though, I need to mount the speakers and run the wires
[2019-06-07, 4:19:51 PM] Jamie: Ahh in the garage?
[2019-06-07, 4:20:04 PM] Jamie: Let’s do another bbq!
[2019-06-07, 4:21:23 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm game. And no the speakers will point at the garden area
[2019-06-07, 4:21:45 PM] Rob Feeny: You can connect right to the amp with Bluetooth or via Chromecast
[2019-06-07, 4:24:39 PM] Jamie: Sounds cool
[2019-06-07, 4:30:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Feel free to help me set it up 🤣
[2019-06-07, 4:30:58 PM] Jamie: I’m in. Kinda bored here and itching to do some physical work.
[2019-06-07, 4:31:05 PM] Jamie: Not too much. Just some, haha
[2019-06-07, 4:31:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha perfect. The garden looks awesome, it would be a nice add-on
[2019-06-07, 6:06:01 PM] Jamie: Just made $50 usd for drone videos
[2019-06-07, 6:06:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Sweeeet
[2019-06-07, 6:06:12 PM] Rob Feeny: For surfing or?
[2019-06-07, 6:06:44 PM] Jamie: Yup. A German guy, he was super stoked to have it
[2019-06-07, 6:07:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Killer, and for a German that's probably not a lot
[2019-06-07, 6:07:42 PM] Jamie: Exactly. Pays for my rent and food for 2 days
[2019-06-07, 6:08:37 PM] Jamie: Brings my total non taxable income to $129.00 CAD and I paid $650 for the drone. No bad for a start
[2019-06-07, 6:08:59 PM] Jamie: I wanna try to do wake boarding videos in Kelowna
[2019-06-07, 6:10:29 PM] Rob Feeny: How long did it take?
[2019-06-07, 6:10:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Anytime you can make Canadian level income down there it's awesome
[2019-06-07, 6:11:22 PM] Jamie: 2 months but this is the first guy I charged cash. Everything else was just free lunches, coffee, free stays in hostels, etc.
[2019-06-07, 6:11:47 PM] Jamie: The hostel I stay at in Guayaquil when I travel to and from Ecuador, I did a drone video for the owner and now I get free nights whenever I come through
[2019-06-07, 6:12:31 PM] Jamie: Next year we will have the surf videos go live on the Montanita Spanish Schiol website as an add on to surf lessons.
[2019-06-07, 6:13:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome
[2019-06-07, 6:13:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Little by little
‎[2019-06-08, 5:40:39 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-08, 5:40:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ohhhhh shit
[2019-06-08, 5:41:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Monster wave?
[2019-06-08, 5:41:43 PM] Jamie: Not even. Big but not monster. Just bad luck and timing. Wave landed directly on the middle of the board
[2019-06-08, 5:42:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Is it fixable?
[2019-06-08, 5:42:52 PM] Jamie: Not sure yet. Either way I bet it’s $250-300 USD. So close. Tomorrow is my last day here
[2019-06-08, 5:43:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Damnit. Sell it for salvage and buy a new one when you get back?
[2019-06-08, 6:58:43 PM] Jamie: It’s a rental. 😬
[2019-06-08, 7:06:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh crap
[2019-06-08, 7:06:18 PM] Rob Feeny: That bites.
[2019-06-08, 7:10:25 PM] Jamie: 🤷‍♂️ I guess in all my times surfing, I think only once did I break a board. So it was due
[2019-06-09, 8:56:07 AM] Jamie: Friday June 21st for a BBQ at your place?
[2019-06-09, 1:02:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Possible, had tentative plans but don't think they're going to gel, I'll sort it today
[2019-06-09, 1:37:12 PM] Rob Feeny: 21st is a go! You want to create a FB event?
[2019-06-09, 2:14:09 PM] Jamie: Sure. I can do that.
[2019-06-11, 7:24:58 PM] Jamie: How ya doing man?
[2019-06-11, 7:25:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha. Getting better. Just wasted 2.5 entire days tho
[2019-06-11, 7:26:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Just heading in the ADHD screening appt
[2019-06-11, 7:56:14 PM] Jamie: Good to hear Rob
[2019-06-11, 8:02:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Crap that was creepy. He described me to myself.
[2019-06-11, 8:03:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Talked about the kinds of jobs I probably excelled at and those I struggled at.
[2019-06-11, 8:04:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Eg being a server, working on shorter duration, deadline based work, public facing tasks etc. While I would struggle with self directed, open-ended tasks like planning and research projects
[2019-06-11, 8:07:42 PM] Jamie: And does he have a solution? Or is the knowledge of your personality type itself part of the solution?
[2019-06-11, 8:08:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm Well he wants me to try the meds. Extended release Ritalin. Gave me coupons for a couple of months supply
[2019-06-11, 8:09:04 PM] Rob Feeny: But also some literature and links to resources
[2019-06-11, 8:11:30 PM] Jamie: I’m sure you will do your research and monitor them
[2019-06-11, 8:31:49 PM] Jamie: French people are super fucking ignorant.  This hostile and Matt is full of French Canadians and there’s no point in me even being around the group. Constant French no English
[2019-06-11, 8:36:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Hostel? And yes, yes they are
[2019-06-11, 8:38:54 PM] Jamie: Yeah it’s a hostel in Puerto Engabao. Nothing but the hostel and surfing. About 10 young pretty girls from Quebec and a couple guys but after about 4 times where I started a conversation in English with someone only to have her friend say something in French and then I wasn’t in the conversation anymore. Got here last night and I’m done with them.
[2019-06-11, 8:39:49 PM] Jamie: Surf, run, eat and work on the drone video I am doing for them. But it’s annoying to be locked in my room with all these people around
[2019-06-11, 8:41:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Just googled it. Working your way down the coast to Guayaquil?
[2019-06-11, 8:42:17 PM] Jamie: Sort of. A surfing buddy of mine I met a few year back moved here last year. His girlfriend opened the hostel and offered free stay for some done vids.
[2019-06-11, 8:43:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh killer. Sadly it seems to attract Quebecoise
[2019-06-11, 8:45:02 PM] Jamie: Yup. I know I have low tolerance but I tried for a full day, lol.
[2019-06-11, 8:45:39 PM] Jamie: My buddy left today to drive his gf to Guayaquil and go to the dentist. Will be better when he is back tomorrow afternoon
[2019-06-11, 9:07:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Btw you should get on making that FB event. Vancouverites in June are nuts for packing their weekends
[2019-06-14, 9:47:06 AM] Jamie: Any chance I can get a ride from the airport on Monday?
[2019-06-14, 10:23:59 AM] Rob Feeny: What time?
[2019-06-14, 10:24:57 AM] Rob Feeny: sure I can do it
[2019-06-14, 11:25:10 AM] Rob Feeny: Want to do the Burnaby Mountain run on Thursday?
[2019-06-14, 11:46:45 AM] Jamie: Flight comes in at 6am 😬
[2019-06-14, 12:12:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh you bastard
[2019-06-14, 1:32:43 PM] Jamie: Haha I actually figured it might help you be up and moving early. But I can wait st the airport too if you want to do your meeting with Morgan
[2019-06-14, 1:37:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Well actually I was thinking you could help me pick up a motorcycle on the way back and get it into the metris van...
[2019-06-14, 2:01:40 PM] Jamie: Sure.
[2019-06-14, 8:41:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey you said you were staying Mon and Tues, sticking around until the party as well or do you have a place sorted?
[2019-06-14, 8:41:50 PM] Rob Feeny: I have a friend looking for a couch, might bump u to the camper
[2019-06-14, 10:04:44 PM] Jamie: Was gonna spend a night at Morgan’s but I would be happy with the camper.
[2019-06-14, 10:45:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, my friend Phil might be around for a couple of the nights, he's couch surfing until he gets his place
[2019-06-15, 12:33:22 PM] Jamie: Ouch. Haven’t run in a while but I’ll try
[2019-06-15, 12:34:44 PM] Rob Feeny: You can do it, fatty!
‎[2019-06-16, 2:10:02 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-16, 2:28:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok so does 5:45 work? Gives you time to pass customs and get your luggage
[2019-06-16, 4:33:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to make some cash on Tuesday working on the Fortuga? Otherwise I'm grabbing a Mexico laborer
[2019-06-16, 4:33:42 PM] Rob Feeny: *mexican
[2019-06-16, 5:41:59 PM] Jamie: 5:45 is fine, no worries.
[2019-06-16, 5:42:21 PM] Jamie: I think my boots and tools are on starage at Georgia. But sure
[2019-06-16, 5:42:34 PM] Jamie: Not at 4:30 in the morning though, lol
[2019-06-16, 5:44:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha no, that's Paul. I usually get up at 6
[2019-06-16, 5:55:13 PM] Jamie: That better!
[2019-06-16, 5:56:06 PM] Jamie: I just found out I can get back into Ecuador in the anniversary of the first time I went, not the anniversary of last years tourist visa start. That’s great news! I can go back on the 15th of October
[2019-06-16, 6:08:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha sweet, when were you looking at before?
[2019-06-17, 7:11:29 AM] Jamie: Nov 29th. Just landed, btw
[2019-06-17, 7:12:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok, a bit behind, just leaving the house
[2019-06-17, 7:13:55 AM] Rob Feeny: So fekkin tired
[2019-06-17, 7:14:08 AM] Jamie: All good. I’m in no hurry
[2019-06-17, 7:15:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay good because I still have to swap vehicles
[2019-06-17, 7:37:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Google says 5:55
[2019-06-17, 7:40:28 AM] Jamie: Ok just cleared customs and grabbing my bag
[2019-06-17, 7:43:52 AM] Jamie: I will text when I have my bag but you should be able to just cruise through arrivals and I will be there
[2019-06-17, 7:45:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2019-06-17, 7:54:17 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm in the cell phone waiting area
[2019-06-17, 7:58:09 AM] Jamie: My bag is either going to be the very last one out or lost again, lol.
[2019-06-17, 7:58:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha the airlines hate you
[2019-06-17, 7:58:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Probably for flying in from such ridiculous remote locations
[2019-06-17, 7:59:03 AM] Jamie: I honestly think it’s because it doesn’t stack well so they leave it till the end
[2019-06-17, 8:01:38 AM] Jamie: Got it and I am clear
[2019-06-17, 8:03:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay on my way I'm in Morgan's white metris van
[2019-06-17, 12:49:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy I feel like I got hit by a bus
[2019-06-17, 12:50:02 PM] Jamie: I’m here
[2019-06-18, 12:03:49 AM] Jamie: This is cozy as hell
[2019-06-18, 12:03:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha awesome
[2019-06-18, 12:04:02 AM] Rob Feeny: I enjoy it
[2019-06-18, 12:04:39 AM] Jamie: Shakes pretty heavy when I move. You could get this thing rockin’ haha
[2019-06-18, 12:04:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Maybe I have ;)
[2019-06-18, 12:05:09 AM] Rob Feeny: I contemplated stabilization jacks but it's not worth the hassle
[2019-06-18, 12:05:21 AM] Jamie: Part of the charm
[2019-06-18, 2:42:50 PM] Jamie: Food spiked paper bag? Where does it go?
[2019-06-18, 2:44:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Compost
[2019-06-18, 2:45:07 PM] Rob Feeny: The compost bin is outside soaking so just toss it in the green lid bin outside
[2019-06-18, 2:56:33 PM] Jamie: Ok great. Also I can’t find my case of adapters/cords etc. Did you see it?
[2019-06-18, 2:56:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm. Nope, haven't touched it
[2019-06-18, 2:59:30 PM] Jamie: Got it. Was under my pants
[2019-06-18, 8:15:02 PM] Jamie: Plans for dinner?
[2019-06-18, 8:30:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Still working, just ate pizza
[2019-06-18, 8:36:51 PM] Rob Feeny: We've gotten a huge amount  done
[2019-06-18, 8:39:58 PM] Jamie: Nice. Ok. I will have Hong Sushi
‎[2019-06-18, 9:19:38 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-18, 9:20:48 PM] Jamie: Looks like a room, not a truck!
[2019-06-18, 9:28:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Crazy hey?
[2019-06-18, 9:35:56 PM] Jamie: Yeah. You have plans for the space? Should build it in this software I have. So easy with 3D
[2019-06-18, 9:37:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to help me with that?
[2019-06-18, 9:56:42 PM] Jamie: Totally
[2019-06-18, 10:05:41 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm about to be that guy try to return about $600 worth of stuff at Home Depot
[2019-06-18, 10:06:01 PM] Rob Feeny: *and
[2019-06-18, 10:06:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll be home at 9 for beers if you're around
[2019-06-18, 10:06:43 PM] Jamie: Sounds good
[2019-06-19, 11:46:18 AM] Jamie: What’s the razor you would suggest I buy? Which one do you have?
[2019-06-19, 11:51:19 AM] Rob Feeny: I have a Braun shaver with pop-out trimmer. I use the trimmer most of the time on my face to leave me with stubble but the shaver works for a reasonable close shave.
[2019-06-19, 11:51:54 AM] Rob Feeny: I use the trimmer part on other bits, if I'm traveling and need to trim without going stubble-short, I use a comb
[2019-06-19, 11:52:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha
[2019-06-19, 11:52:12 AM] Rob Feeny: If I'm home I have a body groomee
[2019-06-19, 11:52:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Groomer
[2019-06-19, 11:52:36 AM] Rob Feeny: I have a 10yr old 5 Series that's still going strong with the original battery!
[2019-06-19, 11:52:39 AM] Jamie: Actually the comb is a good idea. Simple
[2019-06-19, 11:52:54 AM] Rob Feeny: It's how I trim my sideburns too
[2019-06-19, 11:54:42 AM] Jamie: Nice. Sounds good. I’m looking now
[2019-06-19, 2:29:02 PM] Jamie: Does it look like you’re gonna be there all day?
[2019-06-19, 2:34:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes at this rate
[2019-06-19, 2:40:41 PM] Jamie: Ahh ok. Probably going to meet Matt Crane for a beer later I was just wondering if you’ll need the car
[2019-06-19, 2:43:01 PM] Rob Feeny: No go ahead
[2019-06-19, 5:11:01 PM] Jamie: Probably should have called. Rob Autar wasn’t there and cash wasn’t at westcoast
[2019-06-19, 5:31:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah crap of course
[2019-06-19, 8:18:04 PM] Jamie: I was thinking about going for some Vietnamese soon. What are you doing for dinner?
[2019-06-19, 8:19:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhhh I'm fucked, I'm way out in Langley and the van won't be done today
[2019-06-19, 8:19:10 PM] Rob Feeny: It's not even running now 😢
[2019-06-19, 8:19:15 PM] Jamie: Need me to come get you?
[2019-06-19, 8:19:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes, it looks like it
[2019-06-19, 8:20:00 PM] Jamie: Ok where are you? Can I leave now?
[2019-06-19, 8:20:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep
[2019-06-19, 8:20:53 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll send a pin
[2019-06-19, 8:20:56 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2019-06-19, 8:24:12 PM] Rob Feeny: 3497 205 St
3497 205 St, Langley City, BC V2Z 2C9
https://maps.app.goo.gl/HrgyNPrJg7pcZujC8
[2019-06-19, 8:24:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Your bed has to stay here for the night
[2019-06-19, 8:26:14 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a long way :S
[2019-06-19, 8:28:28 PM] Jamie: Rush-hour traffic too. Ducker.
[2019-06-19, 8:29:06 PM] Rob Feeny: It's should be ending...
[2019-06-19, 8:29:18 PM] Rob Feeny: But I can wait a while, I have my laptop
[2019-06-19, 8:29:30 PM] Jamie: I’m already on my way
[2019-06-19, 8:59:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Btw it's basically a little compound you need to come into
[2019-06-19, 9:56:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I understand you want to get away from the conflict. I do that same thing. You're in an area that is hard to get transit in. I can give you a ride home without speaking to you or making things worse. I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable.
[2019-06-19, 9:59:49 PM] Jamie: No I think the walk is gonna be fine
[2019-06-19, 9:59:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2019-06-19, 10:08:51 PM] Jamie: Rob what I don’t like here is that you made your reaction / anxiety my fault.
[2019-06-19, 10:17:48 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm not sure what to say, Jamie. When I tried to deal with the activity that was causing my anxiety, I tried to bring it up in a way that that wasn't attacking (by saying they're now ticketing for it) but it was a legitimate concern. I was worried you'd react badly to me bringing it up but it was important enough to me that I did it anyway.

Your reaction was what I expected and I got flustered and did say it was disrespectful because I believe it is. I'm sorry if my words hurt you, that was not my intention. I was scrambling to justify my words and didn't select my words with enough care.
[2019-06-19, 10:19:36 PM] Rob Feeny: I understand you just wanted to leave the conflict as soon as possible but the agitated driving and the quick movements made me even more uncomfortable and so I asked to drive.
[2019-06-19, 10:25:13 PM] Rob Feeny: But I guess it boils down to the fact that I believe my discomfort came from your actions combined with an unwillingness to hear, process and respect my discomfort, so yes, my anxiety was your fault. I could have communicated it better, perhaps saying "Your driving is making me anxious, could you move over a few lanes" or "Do you think I could drive?". I don't know if there is a way I could have communicated it that would have been well received.
[2019-06-19, 10:25:26 PM] Jamie: Nothing I can say or do will change your mind about the type of person you think I am. But you’re hard on me Rob and I don’t like it
[2019-06-19, 10:26:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I hear what you're saying and will try to examine my actions and change them.
[2019-06-19, 10:31:05 PM] Rob Feeny: And thank you for picking me up, I appreciate the help.
[2019-06-20, 3:25:28 PM] Jamie: So I was thinking hamburgers for tomorrow night. With all the Fixin’s, maybe even bacon. And potato chips
[2019-06-20, 3:30:17 PM] Rob Feeny: That works. I'm running around the whole day but are you free to sit down tonight and talk?
[2019-06-20, 3:37:47 PM] Jamie: Yeah after Burnaby Mountain
[2019-06-20, 3:38:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I don't think I can run tonight, my shin is not doing well.
[2019-06-20, 3:38:52 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm still limping
[2019-06-20, 3:39:13 PM] Jamie: Shitty. That’s not a good run for injuries
[2019-06-20, 3:39:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah it seems to be getting worse, not better
[2019-06-20, 6:50:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Bad news about the band. It won't be coming back today. And the cleaner comes at 7:30 tomorrow morning so you don't get to sleep in.
[2019-06-20, 6:50:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Van
[2019-06-20, 6:51:08 PM] Jamie: Ok no worries
[2019-06-20, 11:26:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey, sorry the date is going really well, we're coming back to have a fire
[2019-06-21, 12:50:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Van should be done today and damn expensive :S
[2019-06-21, 12:54:48 PM] Jamie: Oh shit. Ok this guy doesn’t get home until 5:30 👎🏻
[2019-06-21, 12:56:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Ugh. Well, the event is listed for 6:30, we could make it work
[2019-06-21, 12:56:56 PM] Jamie: What time will the van be done?
[2019-06-21, 1:01:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Before 5. He's going to call
[2019-06-21, 1:02:01 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2019-06-21, 1:02:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Crashing for a short nap. You at Starbucks for the day?
[2019-06-21, 1:06:48 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-06-21, 1:07:01 PM] Jamie: But was gonna go to commercial at some point
[2019-06-21, 1:07:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, I'll end up there for a couple of hours doing paperwork then get to work on the yard. House looks great now.
[2019-06-21, 1:07:31 PM] Jamie: Let me know when you are up. Was gonna come back and make a smoothly soon. And it’s loud
[2019-06-21, 1:07:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok, gimme 30min? My bedding is in the wash so I'm on the couch
[2019-06-21, 1:08:14 PM] Jamie: Awesome. Oh yeah we are installing the speakers. Ok I will be back in about 45 and we can get those speakers installed

[2019-06-21, 7:43:12 PM] Rob Feeny: There's a dollar store right beside Superstar do you need anything from there?
[2019-06-21, 7:43:33 PM] Jamie: Nope
[2019-06-21, 7:48:33 PM] Jamie: Is there a key to the shed around?
[2019-06-21, 7:48:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes it's on a long skinny blue lanyard
[2019-06-21, 7:48:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Should be at the front entrance or on the dryer
[2019-06-21, 7:51:35 PM] Rob Feeny: got a second to take a quick look at the party supplies and only if we need any more plates or cups or cutlery?
[2019-06-21, 7:57:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Sweet or dill? I prefer dill.

[2019-06-21, 8:15:04 PM] Rob Feeny: If not I'll dig out the last box when I get home
[2019-06-21, 8:19:56 PM] Jamie: Can your beers in the fridge, I don’t see any plastic cutlery and I’m not sure where your toilet paper is but I’m looking for it
[2019-06-21, 8:20:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Go to the wooden shelving in the laundry room
[2019-06-21, 8:20:42 PM] Rob Feeny: And look up high

[2019-06-22, 10:31:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Sweet
[2019-06-22, 10:42:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Do you know where that tensor bandage ended up?
[2019-06-22, 10:42:57 AM] Jamie: Back seat of your car
[2019-06-22, 7:12:31 PM] Rob Feeny: What are you up to tonight?
[2019-06-22, 7:13:11 PM] Jamie: No plans. Janice is having something with Kim and said we could come over
[2019-06-22, 7:13:44 PM] Jamie: Otherwise I would be happy to cook up more burgers
[2019-06-22, 7:14:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, headed home, I need a chill night and early bedtime
[2019-06-23, 12:07:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey if an Amazon package arrives for me, can you fire me a message? It's my new spray foam gun
[2019-06-23, 12:11:44 PM] Jamie: Sure. If I’m here

[2019-06-23, 8:18:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Btw is that your missing cooler?
[2019-06-23, 8:18:55 PM] Jamie: Yup. Totally is
[2019-06-23, 8:19:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Saw it yesterday
[2019-06-24, 10:49:31 AM] Rob Feeny: Grill up some burgers tonight? When do you move to Kat's?

[2019-06-24, 12:54:40 PM] Rob Feeny: My laptop might be on its way out :S
[2019-06-24, 12:55:03 PM] Jamie: It’s flaking?
[2019-06-24, 12:55:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Power cord is dying, 2 reboots to get the trackpad working
[2019-06-24, 12:56:53 PM] Jamie: Still might be repairable
[2019-06-24, 12:57:08 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a 2009, not really worth it
[2019-06-24, 12:57:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Worth maybe $200
[2019-06-25, 12:21:02 PM] Jamie: Braun did the job. A little weird not using a blade and it’s not perfect (I will get better) but it was easy and cheaper in the long run. Thanks for the recommendation!
[2019-06-25, 12:23:15 PM] Rob Feeny: No prob, glad it worked
[2019-06-25, 12:23:44 PM] Jamie: Can’t wait to clear out my shaving / trimming kit!
‎[2019-06-26, 10:53:57 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-26, 11:01:15 AM] Jamie: Maybe but I don’t think I took it out of storage this visit.
[2019-06-26, 11:25:15 AM] Rob Feeny: Strange. I'll ask Christian
[2019-06-26, 12:00:48 PM] Jamie: Maybe it was on top of everything and I didn’t notice when I pulled things out of my bin?
[2019-06-26, 12:03:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe? I'd see it as something you packed in with the blender
[2019-06-26, 12:04:02 PM] Jamie: Makes sense. I was trying to keep a full kitchen setup, Tupperware, knives, pots/pans, blender etc
[2019-06-26, 12:05:00 PM] Jamie: Made beef stew in Kat’s slow cooker. 350 calories per serving, about $3.75 for a big bowl. 7 servings.
[2019-06-26, 12:07:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha you're turning into me
[2019-06-26, 12:08:22 PM] Jamie: Honestly you are kind of my role model in that area
[2019-06-26, 12:09:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha thanks. I can certainly live efficiently
‎[2019-06-27, 10:29:36 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-27, 10:34:20 AM] Jamie: How thick are the walls?
[2019-06-27, 10:34:29 AM] Jamie: And the floor?
[2019-06-27, 10:35:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm does it matter?
[2019-06-27, 10:35:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Let's say front and rear wall at 4"
[2019-06-27, 10:35:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh, those are interior measurement
[2019-06-27, 10:36:04 AM] Jamie: Ahhh ok then it doesn’t matter so much
[2019-06-27, 10:38:02 AM] Jamie: Did intervals last night and it hurt
[2019-06-27, 10:39:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha I bet! I lifted weights then sheets of plywood and I'm hurting today
[2019-06-27, 1:17:52 PM] Jamie: How does your man door open? And what’s the space between the doors and walls?
[2019-06-27, 1:19:00 PM] Rob Feeny: It rolls up, the roll goes in the space above the door, mounted on the inside
[2019-06-27, 1:19:42 PM] Jamie: The man door rolls up too?
[2019-06-27, 1:19:46 PM] Rob Feeny: And there's very minimal space, I'd say 4" between the wall and man door, between the man door and roll up door and the roll up door and wall
[2019-06-27, 1:20:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha missed that. It swings inward hinging on the side near the wall
[2019-06-27, 1:20:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Just cut Party Cat's nails. What a traumatic experience.
[2019-06-27, 1:21:13 PM] Jamie: Ok cool
‎[2019-06-27, 1:45:44 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-27, 1:51:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Very cool!
[2019-06-27, 1:51:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Damnit I didn't think to measure the existing counter I put in
[2019-06-27, 1:52:01 PM] Jamie: And did you put some fan cutouts in?
[2019-06-27, 1:53:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Not yet. I'll be there tomorrow. They'll be very high, 4" round vents each one about 5' from the front/end on the passenger side
[2019-06-27, 1:54:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm curious how to lay out the interior. Maybe cabinets/work benches along the passenger wall and saving the driver side for racking of some sort
[2019-06-27, 1:56:09 PM] Rob Feeny: I want to have something to keep store 4x8 sheets of plywood on their side, as well as racking for lumber and larger items like bundles of insulation
[2019-06-27, 1:56:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Probably keeping the first 8ft of the shop empty to roll in saws etc or work if it's raining
[2019-06-27, 1:57:25 PM] Jamie: Ok grab all the measurement of things you can think of and Sunday we can enter it and move it around
[2019-06-27, 1:57:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow almost 32ft of length
[2019-06-27, 1:57:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Sounds good. Might use the loft for storage or even throw a mattress in there for crashing on site
[2019-06-27, 2:01:05 PM] Rob Feeny: It's crazy that I want to go there now and work but I know that from 3pm to 7pm getting back is a nightmare due to traffic
[2019-06-27, 8:19:49 PM] Jamie: Transit is crazy expensive without a pass. It’s costing me $10 a day
[2019-06-27, 8:20:03 PM] Jamie: Can’t buy the pass until the 1 st
[2019-06-27, 8:20:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm and what's a day pass worth?
[2019-06-27, 8:20:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to borrow a bike?
[2019-06-27, 8:21:36 PM] Jamie: I should be fine by Monday but I’ve gone through $40 worth of stored value in 4 days. Crazy
[2019-06-27, 8:21:46 PM] Jamie: Good point. I’ll check
[2019-06-27, 8:22:06 PM] Rob Feeny: When you think of the cost of a car, insurance, gas, maintenance
[2019-06-27, 8:22:13 PM] Rob Feeny: It's probably still cheaper
[2019-06-27, 8:25:03 PM] Jamie: Totally. But if you arrive in Vancouver halfway through the month, it is 3 times as expensive for those 15 days. Just complaining, lol
[2019-06-27, 8:40:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahah the life of a poor peasant 🤣
[2019-06-27, 8:41:15 PM] Jamie: Indeed. There’s a satisfaction in it though.
[2019-06-28, 1:49:16 PM] Jamie: What thickness?

[2019-06-28, 2:34:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Very cool! I've got 15min of painting left then I'll measure the costing workbench, but I'd say that racking would be deeper
[2019-06-28, 2:34:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Gimme a few
[2019-06-28, 2:35:10 PM] Jamie: Ok I went with 12”, 18” and 2’. No worries. Heading to the grocery store

[2019-06-28, 3:48:57 PM] Jamie: Lol ok better.
[2019-06-28, 3:49:14 PM] Rob Feeny: That thing starts 64" from the corner by the door.
[2019-06-28, 3:49:18 PM] Jamie: Is that a Mexican leg I see?
[2019-06-28, 3:49:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahah yep
[2019-06-28, 3:49:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Cute but not very useful
[2019-06-28, 3:49:53 PM] Rob Feeny: But good company
[2019-06-28, 3:51:47 PM] Jamie: Gotta get that bed in there stat!
[2019-06-28, 3:52:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha little 18yr old soccer player. Friend of the cleaner
[2019-06-28, 3:52:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Too shy tho
‎[2019-06-28, 3:54:08 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-28, 3:54:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Drew it out at the truck and forgot the drawing
[2019-06-28, 4:00:57 PM] Rob Feeny: So Myles is at a concert tonight  but are you still interested in doing burgers?
[2019-06-28, 4:03:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Don't feel pressured tho, it's a long way
[2019-06-28, 4:04:02 PM] Jamie: Maybe he is around tomorrow night for burgers?
[2019-06-28, 4:04:05 PM] Rob Feeny: In transit haha
[2019-06-28, 4:04:29 PM] Rob Feeny: We can see. I know he's in for Sunday and probably has friends to visit
[2019-06-28, 4:05:39 PM] Jamie: Haha, I was doing the logistics. I want to run in the morning so I would have to bring everything with me and leave your house early
[2019-06-28, 4:06:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Where's the run?
[2019-06-28, 4:06:41 PM] Jamie: False Creek
[2019-06-28, 4:06:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok pretty far
[2019-06-28, 4:07:54 PM] Jamie: Well what about Sat night instead? Even without Myles. I’ll just hang out at Starbucks the next day until Elexs dinner
[2019-06-28, 4:10:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure that works. I am hoping I feel well enough by Sunday to go for a hike or someone sort of adventure
[2019-06-28, 4:10:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Saturday I'm just working on the van/house
[2019-06-28, 4:10:49 PM] Rob Feeny: BBQing goes well with puttering days
[2019-06-28, 4:12:59 PM] Jamie: Ok cool. Let’s do that. I will swing by in the late afternoon after the run / shower / errands etc
[2019-06-28, 4:13:54 PM] Jamie: Haha it’s so cold in this house, I’m sitting on the toilet with a hairdryer
[2019-06-28, 4:21:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha your favorite toy
[2019-06-28, 4:21:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I own 3 space heaters, want one?
[2019-06-28, 4:22:07 PM] Jamie: I think I will be alright. I expect it to get warmer soon!
[2019-06-28, 4:29:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha even this weekend with all the sun is supposed to only hit like 25
[2019-06-29, 12:19:49 PM] Jamie: I have such a hard time waking up for the 9:30 False Creek.
[2019-06-29, 12:20:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Missed it?
[2019-06-29, 12:20:51 PM] Jamie: Yup. Lol. So I’m meeting Morgan at around 3 for a couple beer then heading to your place. Haven’t heard anything from Myles but morgan will probably hang for a beer, maybe a burger
[2019-06-29, 12:22:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sounds good. I'll be here all day working
[2019-06-29, 8:05:42 PM] Jamie: I’m working on morgan to leave right now
[2019-06-29, 8:06:09 PM] Rob Feeny: No stress, still working
‎[2019-06-29, 8:06:17 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-06-29, 8:28:25 PM] Jamie: On our way. Need anything for burgs?
[2019-06-29, 8:33:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I'll see how many buns there are
[2019-06-29, 8:34:25 PM] Rob Feeny: I only have 3
[2019-06-29, 8:34:34 PM] Rob Feeny: And could use tomato
[2019-06-29, 8:43:14 PM] Jamie: Have any beer?
[2019-06-29, 8:43:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Only 2 big bottles
[2019-06-29, 8:43:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry been a busy day
[2019-07-01, 12:15:36 AM] Jamie: Wearing earplugs on the bus makes me a happier person, ha ha
[2019-07-01, 12:16:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha I like eavesdropping

[2019-07-03, 10:05:23 AM] Jamie: Slick!
[2019-07-03, 10:05:46 AM] Rob Feeny: They make my buddy Ben's laptop cover, looks like an old leather bound book
[2019-07-03, 10:05:56 AM] Rob Feeny: When I get a newer laptop I'm getting one
[2019-07-03, 1:20:10 PM] Jamie: I like it.
[2019-07-04, 11:51:05 AM] Jamie: How you doing today Rob?
[2019-07-04, 11:52:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Starting the day was a struggle. I'm doing better now. Took some stims. Getting some stuff done.

[2019-07-04, 11:55:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow it's beautiful
[2019-07-04, 11:55:27 AM] Jamie: Totally
[2019-07-04, 12:34:47 PM] Rob Feeny: I think I'm going to keep myself slightly drifted up until I've built the momentum to keep rolling
[2019-07-04, 12:50:42 PM] Rob Feeny: And then on Tuesday, I have a doctor's appointment and I think I'm going to try the ADHD meds
[2019-07-04, 12:52:15 PM] Jamie: It makes sense to have all the variables. Try it and see how it fits with what you have learned
[2019-07-05, 2:39:25 PM] Jamie: Applied for MSP premium assistance and I’m getting $262.50 back. Not bad for 25 min of work
[2019-07-05, 2:39:47 PM] Jamie: Also get $23 off any massage / chirp etc up to 10 visits
[2019-07-05, 2:45:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha not bad at all. I should do my taxes and see if I qualify
‎[2019-07-05, 2:45:12 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-05, 2:45:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck.
[2019-07-05, 2:45:28 PM] Jamie: What’s that?
[2019-07-05, 2:45:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Need another solution for the shower. I'm thinking vinyl
[2019-07-05, 2:45:35 PM] Rob Feeny: The shower wall in the camper
[2019-07-05, 2:45:46 PM] Jamie: Oh right. The reaction.  Was this the second fix?
[2019-07-05, 2:46:49 PM] Rob Feeny: No, another spot. I tried drying it more and using a lighter touch, less sticky tape
[2019-07-05, 2:47:16 PM] Rob Feeny: For now, at least it's sealed. I'll repaint the damage and now then see about putting peel and stick vinyl on it
[2019-07-05, 2:47:44 PM] Jamie: What else needs to be done on the van?
[2019-07-05, 2:48:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Get it running, fix the leaky faucet then a wash and wax
[2019-07-05, 2:48:31 PM] Jamie: So pretty close considering where you came from
[2019-07-05, 2:49:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. 2 steps forward, 1 step back
[2019-07-05, 2:50:46 PM] Jamie: 2 gross, 1 net. 😂
‎[2019-07-05, 3:10:30 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-05, 3:10:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Zero net? See the cracking around the drain in the tub? I think because the wood it's sitting on has rotted and I've been standing in iy
[2019-07-05, 3:52:39 PM] Jamie: That’s frustrating man
[2019-07-05, 4:00:50 PM] Rob Feeny: But hey at least I'm getting to use my plethora of tools...
‎[2019-07-05, 4:07:43 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-05, 4:07:48 PM] Rob Feeny: And this looks way better
[2019-07-05, 4:10:27 PM] Jamie: Very clean!
[2019-07-05, 4:10:48 PM] Jamie: If it wasn’t for the money and the time, you would be enjoying yourself, lol
[2019-07-05, 4:11:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep
[2019-07-05, 4:23:50 PM] Jamie: So my slow cooker food prep / smoothie diet has been very successful. Each smoothie is about $6 and each slow cooker meal is about $4. Other than little snacks (apples, chips, nuts etc) that’s all I am eating on regular days. They are loaded with protein and good fats plus some carbs for energy.
[2019-07-05, 4:24:35 PM] Jamie: Still $300 a month just for that but very healthy
[2019-07-05, 4:25:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow that's surprising about the smoothies, it makes paying $8-9 somewhere easier to take
[2019-07-05, 4:29:44 PM] Jamie: Yeah the protein is not cheap ($1.25 per scoop x 2) but it doesn’t make me fart too bad. And half an avocado is $1.25 too. Blueberries are expensive too. Could bring it down but it’s so delicious!
[2019-07-05, 5:17:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuck Brooklyn is a babe
[2019-07-05, 5:23:21 PM] Jamie: No doubt about it
[2019-07-06, 1:59:02 PM] Rob Feeny: So I think about maybe 10yrs the battery on my razor has finally called it quits
[2019-07-06, 2:00:05 PM] Jamie: That’s some pretty good return. Do you let it die each time?
[2019-07-06, 2:00:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah it's Nickel metal hydride
[2019-07-06, 2:01:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Heading to a party/street festival in kits today, what are you up to?
[2019-07-06, 2:02:00 PM] Jamie: Just finished the False Creek run. As soon as I get home, shower, eat and then head to Eagle Creek with Morgan to plan a video shoot.
[2019-07-06, 2:06:54 PM] Jamie: But I would be totally down for another backyard bbq / fire. Maybe kabobs or steaks this time. Next weekend?
[2019-07-06, 2:08:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm lll have to see sooner to the date, that's the weekend that we're supposed to do the hotsprt but Keara might not be able to
[2019-07-06, 2:09:29 PM] Jamie: Honestly there’s no reason we can’t do it during the week as well
[2019-07-06, 2:15:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha very true. I want to try cooking right on the coals
[2019-07-06, 2:35:13 PM] Jamie: So steak then
[2019-07-06, 2:35:20 PM] Jamie: Or roast
[2019-07-06, 8:05:23 PM] Jamie: How’s the street festival?
[2019-07-06, 8:10:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Pretty great mab
[2019-07-06, 8:10:43 PM] Rob Feeny: *man
[2019-07-06, 8:11:01 PM] Jamie: Awesome. With some people?
‎[2019-07-06, 8:11:35 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-06, 8:15:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah Dan, the guy I ski with and his crew
[2019-07-06, 8:15:47 PM] Rob Feeny: And cops with assault rifles?!
[2019-07-06, 8:23:20 PM] Jamie: Yeah spending my tax dollars
[2019-07-06, 8:23:32 PM] Jamie: Haha glad you are haveing fun
[2019-07-06, 8:39:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man. And you don't pay taxes anymore!
[2019-07-08, 8:35:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow what a trip. I just stepped outside of reality for 24 hours and it was awe
[2019-07-08, 8:35:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome
[2019-07-08, 8:35:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Went out to Squamish to meet a girl, not sure if I've told you about her
[2019-07-08, 10:34:57 PM] Jamie: I don’t think so. Oh wait. Keira right?
[2019-07-08, 10:35:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha no, Tori. Didn't connect with Keara this trip
[2019-07-08, 10:35:24 PM] Jamie: And why was it so awesome?
[2019-07-08, 10:36:07 PM] Rob Feeny: She was just super cool, very cute, fun. We went to the lake and swam, talked, made dinner then camped out together. Played with her dog
[2019-07-08, 10:36:16 PM] Rob Feeny: But outside of cell service for most of it
[2019-07-08, 10:38:38 PM] Jamie: Sounds pretty good
[2019-07-08, 10:38:53 PM] Rob Feeny: And I forgot the poles for my tent so I slept in her Prius with her and her dog
[2019-07-08, 10:39:22 PM] Jamie: Smooch!
[2019-07-08, 10:39:30 PM] Jamie: *smooth
[2019-07-08, 10:40:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha definitely not intentional
[2019-07-08, 10:41:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I didn't get much sleep. But yah it was fun. She's deadly hot but in a shy, hippy way
[2019-07-08, 10:41:29 PM] Jamie: Just your type
[2019-07-08, 10:41:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Super nice dog too. But a semi nomadic tree planter
[2019-07-08, 10:41:40 PM] Rob Feeny: From Ontario
[2019-07-08, 10:42:12 PM] Rob Feeny: And she hates pics (like seriously so after a past issue with an ex) so I don't have one I can show yah
[2019-07-08, 10:43:53 PM] Jamie: But she has a car so that’s good
[2019-07-08, 10:46:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah that she lives in
[2019-07-08, 10:46:43 PM] Jamie: How old?
[2019-07-08, 10:46:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Smart girl though and great to chat with.
[2019-07-08, 10:46:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha not old enough to date
[2019-07-08, 10:47:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Funny though because the friend that referred her to me is late 20s and she's totally fine with me age. Not sure if I'm ok with hers. She's 22
[2019-07-08, 10:55:08 PM] Jamie: Fine for messing around with
[2019-07-08, 11:00:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah. Tough though, if she were older I'd date her in a heartbeat
[2019-07-09, 6:44:47 PM] Jamie: Uggg I can’t stand living here much longer
[2019-07-09, 6:53:54 PM] Rob Feeny: What's going on?
[2019-07-09, 6:58:00 PM] Jamie: Well Kat is a pack rat and her place is disgusting. Vacuum doesn’t work, washing machine leaves stains and there is no dryer. She has so much shit all over the place I can move 5 feet without tripping over another bag of stuff she bought and didn’t put away. I’m severely claustrophobic living here
[2019-07-09, 6:58:21 PM] Jamie: can’t*
[2019-07-09, 6:59:17 PM] Jamie: My room is full of her hiking gear / shoe collection and stinks like someone else’s sweat and feet. I have to leave the window and door open all day to vent the smell
[2019-07-09, 6:59:26 PM] Jamie: Not even sure what to do honestly.
[2019-07-09, 7:00:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Rent a place somewhere else?
[2019-07-09, 7:00:38 PM] Jamie: Yeah for next year. I’m going to Kelowna at the end of the month.
[2019-07-09, 7:01:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Tough day man?
[2019-07-09, 7:01:11 PM] Rob Feeny: It's hard at times coming back to reality!
[2019-07-09, 7:02:26 PM] Jamie: Yeah a little. If I could clean the carpet in the room and wash my clothes, I would feel a lot better!
[2019-07-09, 7:03:33 PM] Jamie: Also in Vancouver, I kind of feel like a loser living in this shitty little place thats smelly and unclean.
[2019-07-09, 7:04:08 PM] Jamie: Online dating is an emotional roller coaster that I can’t really handle too, haha. It makes me depressed
[2019-07-09, 7:07:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. And feeling the need to compete with the Vancouverites is also challenging
[2019-07-09, 7:08:57 PM] Jamie: Very much so.
[2019-07-09, 7:09:14 PM] Jamie: But I am really struggling the most with being alone.
[2019-07-09, 7:11:51 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet. I'd suggest finding a shared living situation but those also tend to be messy
[2019-07-09, 7:12:11 PM] Jamie: Not that kind of lonely
[2019-07-09, 7:12:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, even that helps some. And puts you into more contact with people
[2019-07-09, 7:12:59 PM] Rob Feeny: So a greater chance of meeting someone
[2019-07-09, 7:15:23 PM] Jamie: You would think. But even when I am meeting lots of people, it’s been a long time since any girl took an interest in me. I can write it off to the city, the travelling, the working too much all of those things but in the end nothing has clicked.
[2019-07-09, 7:16:11 PM] Jamie: Crazy to say it but I’ve often thought that when I run out money trying to make myself happy, if I am still alone, I will just kill myself.
[2019-07-09, 7:16:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, one thing I have certainly been working on myself is showing clear interest in girls. I realized that I tend to be into the ones that show me signals, and realized it probably works in reverse
[2019-07-09, 7:16:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Where you at?
[2019-07-09, 7:16:50 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll come by
[2019-07-09, 7:17:22 PM] Rob Feeny: At Kat's?
[2019-07-09, 7:17:22 PM] Jamie: I’m heading to dinner with some running group people. I’m not suicidal Rob but I appreciate your offer
[2019-07-09, 7:17:44 PM] Rob Feeny: I have to say I completely understand Jamie. I've been there
[2019-07-09, 7:17:52 PM] Jamie: I figured you would.
[2019-07-09, 7:18:13 PM] Rob Feeny: It does get better. And then it gets worse. And then it gets better
[2019-07-09, 7:18:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Some days I feel exactly the same way but then some days I am scared that I felt that way in the past
[2019-07-09, 7:20:01 PM] Rob Feeny: I think Graciela really did me a favor when she told me I have to find my own happiness
[2019-07-09, 7:20:11 PM] Rob Feeny: It can't come from someone else
[2019-07-09, 7:21:17 PM] Rob Feeny: I've spent the last few years telling myself that I'm happier, that I can be happy, that I can choose to be happier. And you know what? It's working.
[2019-07-09, 7:21:18 PM] Jamie: Yeah I’ve been working on that but unfortunately when I get back from them is a muddled mess. I might be willing to show interest and have figured out exactly how to portray that, but they don’t have to.
[2019-07-09, 7:26:04 PM] Jamie: I get that and I certainly don’t expect to get it from someone I date. But it would be nice to know that someone finds me attractive and worth putting a little effort in
[2019-07-09, 7:26:22 PM] Jamie: Not towards my happiness just even towards dating
[2019-07-09, 7:29:09 PM] Jamie: And there are no resources for this. Just how to bang chicks and make $$.
[2019-07-09, 7:30:26 PM] Jamie: If I try too hard that’s unattractive, if I don’t try hard enough, I’m too passive and an aggressive guy gets the girl.
[2019-07-09, 7:34:35 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a twisted game, especially for guys like us that don't enjoy being aggressive
[2019-07-09, 7:34:40 PM] Jamie: I’ve tried posting on forums / Reddit about my struggles in relating to women and have just been attacked. It feels like a really unhealthy place out there.
[2019-07-09, 7:36:31 PM] Rob Feeny: I could guess that your current lifestyle scares some girls off. Maybe spending times in areas that attract people with similar lifestyles? Squamish, Revelstoke, Tofino...
[2019-07-09, 7:36:34 PM] Jamie: It’s seem like the men that do well are the ones that are insensitive to the situation, they just go after what they want and miss any signals that she may not be that interested.
[2019-07-09, 7:37:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha you should buy a camper van. The kind of girls that are into a semi nomadic lifestyle are into those. Plus it solves there "Where to live" problem
[2019-07-09, 7:37:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep exactly. It's like business. Morgan can just ignore signals or unhappiness so he can cut corners and push it which makes him more money
[2019-07-09, 7:38:15 PM] Jamie: Haha I was scaring off girls before this lifestyle. This lifestyle is partly due to the fact that I could not seem to relate to Canadian / Vancouver women. I really was hoping that I would meet someone from another country that would be different
[2019-07-09, 7:39:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm but in the countries/cities you're in, I would think a lot of the people are young/on vacation.
[2019-07-09, 7:39:38 PM] Jamie: And the rhetoric out there says guys shouldn’t be aggressive.
[2019-07-09, 7:41:53 PM] Jamie: Like I said, a million explanations as to why I can’t meet someone but eventually I have to realize that it is something about me and not my surroundings. And I don’t know how to change. I’ve spent hundreds of hours reading about relationships etc but I still feel like o have some sort of defect that women can smell
[2019-07-09, 7:42:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Ever contemplated a dating coach or service?
[2019-07-09, 7:44:47 PM] Jamie: No
[2019-07-09, 7:45:29 PM] Rob Feeny: I've definitely contemplated taking 6 months to a year off and checking myself into a monastery somewhere in Asia to try to change the basic underlying way my brain works
[2019-07-09, 7:46:47 PM] Jamie: That’s what my trip was supposed to be.
[2019-07-09, 7:47:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I'm of the mind that real, rapid change needs some sort of guidance
[2019-07-09, 7:47:58 PM] Rob Feeny: If you're the one unhappy with your brain, maybe your brain shouldn't be in charge of the changes?
[2019-07-09, 7:48:30 PM] Rob Feeny: I liked the idea of being in a space with others that can serve as examples for me
[2019-07-09, 7:52:26 PM] Jamie: I wish I still had some faith in councillors / therapists. But I don’t. The cost vs benefit was way out of whack, even when I was working. I really believed that the answer was there
[2019-07-09, 7:53:37 PM] Jamie: It was nice having someone to talk to but waaaaaaay to expensive
[2019-07-09, 7:53:46 PM] Jamie: *too
[2019-07-09, 7:54:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I get that.
[2019-07-09, 7:56:32 PM] Jamie: I will just try to build something here and in Ecuador to keep myself from dwelling on it. But I think I will turn off the online dating again because it gives me hope which makes the disappointment hot harder
[2019-07-09, 7:56:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Makes sense.
[2019-07-09, 7:57:21 PM] Rob Feeny: You should do what a guy in Kelowna did. Start a whole hiking group/service/club thing that he later admitted was only for him to meet someone
[2019-07-09, 7:57:25 PM] Rob Feeny: 😅
[2019-07-09, 8:00:32 PM] Jamie: If it works it’s a great story. If it doesn’t it just another sad attempt. I don’t want to talk about it anymore man but thanks for your support
[2019-07-09, 8:01:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok man, hope the dinner is enjoyable
[2019-07-09, 8:07:03 PM] Jamie: Do you know the part that pisses me off the most? If I show any annoyance or frustration with a girls inconsiderate behaviour immediately I become the bad guy. We just have to take the crappy behaviour without saying anything and see that as some sort of acceptable communication.
[2019-07-09, 8:07:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha it's a shitty time to be a guy. Especially a white one. Shame we weren't born 20 years earlier
[2019-07-10, 12:28:12 AM] Jamie: https://www.cocooninnovations.com/product_info.php?cat_id=61&product_id=230
[2019-07-10, 12:28:16 AM] Jamie: I want!
[2019-07-10, 12:53:14 PM] Jamie: https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/cb4wmo/a_guide_to_help_with_difficult_emotions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app
[2019-07-10, 12:54:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Very interesting
[2019-07-10, 12:54:38 PM] Jamie: Any little bit helps
[2019-07-10, 12:56:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. It makes me think a bit about what I learned from "the power of now" about how your brain isn't you and you aren't your brain. Your brain can be freaking out but that doesn't mean you have to be.
[2019-07-10, 1:44:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Btw I still have that one if you want to read it
[2019-07-10, 1:45:01 PM] Jamie: Sure. I want to read some books not on my phone
[2019-07-10, 1:45:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha totally. I followed your lead and got a library card, actually
[2019-07-10, 1:45:53 PM] Jamie: It’s great. Also gets you access to a bunch of digital resources like Lynda.com
[2019-07-10, 1:47:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh crazy
[2019-07-10, 1:47:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I know it can get you ebooks from basically any library too
[2019-07-10, 1:48:33 PM] Jamie: I use an app called Libby and have both the Vancouver and Burnaby library accessed through it. The app itself is great and gets better all the time
[2019-07-10, 4:00:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Well the ADD meds are $105 a month
[2019-07-10, 4:01:21 PM] Jamie: Crap. Fair pharmacists?
[2019-07-10, 4:01:32 PM] Jamie: pharmacare*
[2019-07-10, 4:01:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll have to look into it.
[2019-07-10, 4:01:59 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm just going to try them out for a month and I got a month free

[2019-07-10, 5:36:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Working on new pics ASAP
‎[2019-07-10, 5:46:03 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-10, 5:46:15 PM] Rob Feeny: hahah thanks
‎[2019-07-10, 5:50:31 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-10, 5:51:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, good to know. In the app you have an option
[2019-07-10, 5:51:29 PM] Jamie: Actually sign up is there just behind the obnoxious booking pop up. Might be why people do that
[2019-07-10, 5:53:23 PM] Jamie: So I hit sign up and it put me back to the original page, I hit ask owner a question and it made me put a date in. Just some info on a potential clients workflow
[2019-07-10, 6:09:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I'm posting in the RVezy owner's group on FB about it, thanks
[2019-07-10, 10:07:38 PM] Jamie: Got plans for tomorrow night? Feel like doing a barbecue? Super low-key
[2019-07-10, 10:44:42 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm doing a night time service call with Rolando. Friday?
[2019-07-10, 10:45:27 PM] Jamie: Yeah that works. Look like we are 4x4ing Sat instead of Sunday so maybe morgan can just pick me up from your place?
[2019-07-10, 10:45:51 PM] Jamie: I was thinking chicken thighs with some veggies and potatoes in tinfoil.
[2019-07-11, 9:26:36 AM] Rob Feeny: That works. I have a bag of mini potatoes to use up.
[2019-07-11, 1:58:32 PM] Jamie: OK I’ll head over to that side in the afternoon and sit at the Starbucks until you’re done your day
[2019-07-11, 1:59:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Sounds good
‎[2019-07-11, 7:31:18 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-11, 7:31:48 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm in Port Coquitlam I'll see if there's one on the way home
[2019-07-11, 7:32:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok there is
[2019-07-11, 7:46:57 PM] Jamie: It’s almost half price off!
[2019-07-11, 8:15:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll eat boneless skinless ones just for you big guy
‎[2019-07-11, 8:15:13 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-11, 8:15:32 PM] Jamie: Haha thx.
[2019-07-11, 8:20:48 PM] Jamie: Probably better for you too 😉
[2019-07-11, 8:22:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Naw, I need fat and sinew, it makes me stronger
‎[2019-07-11, 9:10:13 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-12, 9:52:44 AM] Rob Feeny: So Dan and Janis have a fridge of foodt to use up
[2019-07-12, 9:53:18 AM] Rob Feeny: We've got potatoes and veggies for dinner tonight
[2019-07-12, 10:54:31 AM] Jamie: Nice! Will they be joining?
[2019-07-12, 10:56:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope I just dropped them off at the airport
[2019-07-12, 12:11:25 PM] Jamie: Haha we will have a feast!
[2019-07-12, 2:59:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you care if I put the BBQing out there on FB? Anyone looking for a chill BBQ/fire session
[2019-07-12, 3:00:22 PM] Jamie: Nah all good
[2019-07-12, 3:04:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Kk
[2019-07-12, 5:35:53 PM] Rob Feeny: You at Starbucks?
[2019-07-12, 5:36:30 PM] Jamie: Not yet. Just had a beer with Matt on Commercial and I am on the bus heading your way
[2019-07-12, 5:36:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah nice. I'm still working but from home and was going to head there for a coffee
[2019-07-12, 5:37:32 PM] Jamie: I should be there by a little after 4. I need a coffee as well
[2019-07-12, 5:37:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect
[2019-07-12, 7:53:34 PM] Jamie: Have any salsa for tortilla chips?
[2019-07-12, 7:54:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Loads
[2019-07-12, 7:54:41 PM] Jamie: Ok perfect
[2019-07-12, 8:06:14 PM] Jamie: I did not buy a donut
[2019-07-12, 8:33:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Good job, big guy
[2019-07-13, 10:21:25 AM] Jamie: I’m gonna head over to Starbucks. See ya there
[2019-07-13, 11:05:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha slept in pretty well, you still there?
[2019-07-13, 11:05:11 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-07-15, 3:53:25 PM] Rob Feeny: This girl is like a drug. Dangerous.
[2019-07-15, 4:51:41 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah? Lost 2 days to her huh?
[2019-07-15, 4:55:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. Two very pleasant days that involved exercise, good eating, great conversation and lots of sex but yes, it was a bit intense
[2019-07-18, 12:35:12 AM] Jamie: Hey I need to swing by and grab some stuff from your place tomorrow. Any chance there will be a key available somewhere?
[2019-07-18, 12:35:27 AM] Rob Feeny: I can leave one out
[2019-07-18, 12:35:33 AM] Jamie: Thx
[2019-07-18, 12:38:02 AM] Rob Feeny: It's under the recycling bin
[2019-07-18, 12:38:16 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm gone in the am until Friday night, probably won't see you until you're back
[2019-07-18, 12:38:40 AM] Jamie: Cool. Appreciate it. I’m seeing dad Sunday maybe send him a note asking him to give it to me. I’ll try to remember too
[2019-07-18, 12:38:48 AM] Jamie: All good. Back Sunday
[2019-07-18, 12:39:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok sweet thx
[2019-07-18, 1:00:55 PM] Jamie: Got anywhere to mount a surf board in your place? 😂
[2019-07-18, 1:01:11 PM] Jamie: Should make a bar out of it
[2019-07-18, 1:01:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha hmmmm might have space near the bikes?
[2019-07-18, 1:01:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a spare?
[2019-07-18, 1:02:24 PM] Rob Feeny: And shame you're taking passenger tomorrow, Ben needs some drone footage out in Chilliwack (on your way)
[2019-07-18, 1:03:20 PM] Jamie: I leave today at 6. You can use my drone if you want
[2019-07-18, 1:04:08 PM] Jamie: I’ve got that 5’4” that I will bring to Kelowna but thought it might be a cool decoration somewhere
[2019-07-18, 1:05:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh it's today. Naw he's leaving Friday evening with the Tiny and I'm not comfortable flying it
[2019-07-18, 4:34:30 PM] Jamie: Sitting at Fairmont waiting for morgan to come back with the keys to the GLK. It’s been an hour and a half. I’m going to end up rushing all over the fucking place to get all my stuff. Fuuuuuuuuuuck
[2019-07-18, 4:37:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Fuckin' Morgan
[2019-07-18, 4:38:05 PM] Rob Feeny: The first thing I thought when I saw that was "awww crap he has passengers so he has a deadline"
[2019-07-18, 4:38:38 PM] Jamie: Yup. And I have to dig out all the shot at Georgia to get my stuff
[2019-07-18, 4:38:42 PM] Jamie: shit*
[2019-07-18, 5:48:15 PM] Jamie: I’m gonna leave you my two camping chairs
[2019-07-18, 5:48:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sweet thx
[2019-07-18, 7:36:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to do some electrical work for cash next week? Finishing in a Tiny House. What would you be looking for an hour?
[2019-07-18, 7:36:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Or are you headed to Kelowna for longer than the weekend?
[2019-07-19, 10:23:37 AM] Jamie: Yeah I would be down. I’m back Sunday evening. And whatever rate is fair
[2019-07-19, 10:24:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha ok, I'll ask Ben. I know he asked WAV for $50 an hour so I'll see if he can do that
[2019-07-19, 10:25:02 AM] Jamie: Perfect. I would be happy to get that and stoked to work on a tiny house.
[2019-07-19, 10:36:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha I think from his response that he'd so that if you were fast... He's fairly budget. conscious. I figure come in at that rate and if you're not as quick as he wants (he's a speed over quality guy) you could do what I do and just negotiate or trim hours. I do a relaxed pace, text when I want, take calls etc while on site and if I feel the need at the end of the day maybe shave an hour off. He's good to deal with
[2019-07-19, 10:36:54 AM] Rob Feeny: *he'd do that
[2019-07-19, 10:37:42 AM] Jamie: Cool. When?
[2019-07-19, 10:41:56 AM] Rob Feeny: It'd be next week, can he touch base Monday?
[2019-07-19, 10:42:22 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-07-19, 10:43:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Cool. Would you be interested in non-electrical just labor work at a lower rate? Just general work
[2019-07-19, 10:48:29 AM] Jamie: Possibly, if it’s interesting, lol. I’m more valuable with electrical. What’s the labour rate?
[2019-07-19, 10:49:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Maybe $20 cash? I just figured you'd enjoy working on them. Might go $25, depends on skills. There's limited electrical work, is the thing. 1 to 1.5days, in Chilliwack. You could hitch a ride out with us
[2019-07-19, 10:51:08 AM] Jamie: Yeah I’m down. Even just to learn about it
[2019-07-19, 11:21:17 PM] Rob Feeny: How did PopaRide go for you,
[2019-07-19, 11:21:48 PM] Jamie: Went great. Made 80 bucks. And it looks like I'll get 120 on the way back.
[2019-07-19, 11:22:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome! Not bad for a Thurs
[2019-07-19, 11:22:29 PM] Rob Feeny: What did gas cost you?
[2019-07-19, 11:26:54 PM] Jamie: I put $90 in and still have some left. Morgan said $70 each way and he’s about right
[2019-07-19, 11:27:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome, so you're in the black
[2019-07-20, 6:24:09 PM] Rob Feeny: I now need sunglasses to look at the van 😎
[2019-07-20, 6:54:38 PM] Jamie: Did it light on fire? Lol
[2019-07-20, 6:54:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha bastard
[2019-07-20, 6:55:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Scrubbed top to bottom, wiped with bug and tar remover, waxed with carnuba cleaner wax. All windows cleaned and treated, all metal polished
[2019-07-20, 6:55:41 PM] Jamie: Get it running?
[2019-07-20, 6:55:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Worked all morning with this dead sexy little Mexican girl who was wearing jeans that were almost painted on...
[2019-07-20, 6:56:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Dead relay. Plus fixed some small things and had him for a safety inspection
[2019-07-20, 6:56:20 PM] Rob Feeny: *do
[2019-07-20, 6:56:46 PM] Rob Feeny: So he fixed the wobbly speedometer, fixed the turn signal indicator lamp, replaced a dying u-joint
[2019-07-20, 6:56:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Great mechanic to work with
[2019-07-20, 7:07:20 PM] Jamie: I’m glad it turned out fairly cheap
[2019-07-20, 7:07:31 PM] Jamie: Pics ornit didn’t happen
[2019-07-20, 7:12:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I didn't get a pic of her and she had a bf 😭
[2019-07-20, 7:12:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Although I still offered 🤣
‎[2019-07-20, 7:12:54 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-20, 7:13:03 PM] Rob Feeny: She hid from the camera haha
[2019-07-20, 7:20:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Sadly she's leaving in a couple of weeks

[2019-07-20, 10:36:14 PM] Rob Feeny: For your delicate eyes 😅
[2019-07-20, 10:37:23 PM] Jamie: Nice! I’ll have to spend another night in that thing before I go
[2019-07-20, 10:38:57 PM] Rob Feeny: For sure. When are you leaving?
[2019-07-20, 10:49:22 PM] Jamie: Aug 2nd
[2019-07-20, 10:59:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Heading to Kelowna? Or back to Ecuador?
[2019-07-20, 11:00:09 PM] Jamie: Kelowna for a couple months I think. Maybe back to Vancouver before I go to Ecuador Nov.
[2019-07-20, 11:00:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok nice.
[2019-07-20, 11:01:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm picking up Dan & family at the airport on the 1st, you should stop by before you leave
[2019-07-20, 11:02:13 PM] Jamie: For sure. I’d like to get another bbq and fire pit night in as well
[2019-07-20, 11:02:25 PM] Jamie: At least one more
[2019-07-20, 11:03:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Sounds good to me. Although Anna is being a bitch
[2019-07-21, 12:55:57 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh man. Just spotted Melissa on Tinder...
[2019-07-21, 10:10:25 AM] Jamie: Haha are you serious?
[2019-07-21, 11:25:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah Morgan mentioned something about her making him sleep in the spare room last week
‎[2019-07-21, 11:25:28 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-21, 11:25:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Profile said "recently single"
[2019-07-21, 11:26:01 AM] Rob Feeny: Want to know the worst part? While trying to screenshot I accidentally swiped right 😳
[2019-07-21, 11:26:24 AM] Jamie: Oh shit!! Maybe she will swipe right on you, lol
[2019-07-21, 11:26:32 AM] Jamie: Did you get the profile part?
[2019-07-21, 11:26:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope that's what I was trying for
[2019-07-21, 11:29:04 AM] Jamie: Haha
[2019-07-21, 11:44:33 AM] Rob Feeny: Just had a lady back into the van while I was in it. No damage bit she didn't even apologize, just said "oh yah I've done that before"
[2019-07-21, 11:44:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Left me boxed in a tiny spot
[2019-07-21, 11:45:29 AM] Rob Feeny: So I wrote "learn to drive" on her windshield with a candle and left 😅
[2019-07-21, 12:00:45 PM] Jamie: With a candle? Lol
[2019-07-21, 12:00:59 PM] Jamie: Bitch
[2019-07-21, 12:01:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah using it like a grease pencil
[2019-07-21, 8:07:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok so it's looking like Thursday for Tiny House work and maybe Friday if needed. You in? I'll be driving down from my place
[2019-07-21, 9:37:54 PM] Jamie: Yep I’m in
[2019-07-21, 9:41:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Beauty. You'll get to meet Tori, she's coming to help as well
[2019-07-21, 10:02:05 PM] Jamie: What time Thursday morning and where are we going?
[2019-07-21, 10:02:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Early is best. It would be nice to leave at 7... Heading to Rosedale (near Chilliwack). It's about an hour and 20min
[2019-07-21, 10:02:59 PM] Rob Feeny: It's the shop of Tim, the guy who builds Ben's tiny Houses now
[2019-07-21, 10:08:35 PM] Jamie: Ok. It’s an hour by bus so maybe I will sleep at your house Wednesday?
[2019-07-21, 10:14:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure, the van won't be here, it goes out Wednesday but you're welcome to the hide a bed
[2019-07-21, 10:14:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Or I can grab you at Sperling station or another one along the #1
[2019-07-21, 10:15:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Tori will be in my room, her dog will be around but sleeping in my room (it's incredibly well behaved)
[2019-07-21, 10:19:40 PM] Jamie: And the van is rented, right?
[2019-07-21, 10:22:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes
[2019-07-21, 10:22:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Just negotiating another rental
[2019-07-22, 11:01:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Well I have $3,500 in accepted bookings. One for 7 days one for 14
[2019-07-22, 11:01:52 AM] Jamie: Holy shit
[2019-07-22, 11:02:07 AM] Jamie: That’s awesome
[2019-07-22, 11:02:30 AM] Rob Feeny: One is a super long trip, almost 4000km so I basically said "I'll do it for 500$ extra and they went for it
[2019-07-22, 11:02:41 AM] Jamie: Where are they going?
[2019-07-22, 11:04:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Whistler, Banff, Calgary, Yellowstone, Portland, Seattle
[2019-07-22, 12:24:13 PM] Jamie: That’s pretty sweet dude. Do the kms worry you?
[2019-07-22, 12:38:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep. But hey, life worries me
[2019-07-22, 12:54:00 PM] Jamie: Lol

[2019-07-22, 4:09:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Vinyl drawer liner as a shower wall 🤣
[2019-07-22, 4:10:05 PM] Jamie: Very nice! Pro level work haha
‎[2019-07-22, 4:10:58 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-07-22, 4:11:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Almost haha
[2019-07-22, 4:11:05 PM] Rob Feeny: But for $7..
[2019-07-24, 4:40:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Watching that thing roll away was painful to my soul
[2019-07-24, 4:41:35 PM] Jamie: I bet. What’s your biggest worry?
[2019-07-24, 4:44:52 PM] Rob Feeny: They seem like really nice respectful ladies I mostly just worried about them banging it into something
[2019-07-24, 4:45:05 PM] Rob Feeny: And I just realized I forgot to take photos of everything with them there
[2019-07-24, 4:46:23 PM] Jamie: Hamm maybe start a list now for next time
[2019-07-24, 4:46:29 PM] Jamie: hmmm*
[2019-07-24, 4:48:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yah and I need to upload some to do the RVezy checklist
[2019-07-24, 4:48:26 PM] Rob Feeny: *check in
[2019-07-24, 4:56:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I won't be making that mistake again 😬
[2019-07-24, 5:01:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Tori's taking me out to get my car from Langley (mechanic) so I will probably be home around 530 or 6
[2019-07-24, 5:11:22 PM] Jamie: Oh sorry I forgot to mention. Don’t want to sleep on the couch if Tori is there. Rather not listen to that. Gonna run tonight and have something in the slow cooker.
[2019-07-24, 5:13:20 PM] Jamie: I can get to 29th Ave station for 6:45am then Skytrain to where ever you want to grab me.
[2019-07-24, 5:13:43 PM] Jamie: My tools and drill are at your place and I don’t have steel toed boots.
[2019-07-24, 5:14:04 PM] Rob Feeny: we're behaving anyway while she sorts her head out. And I'll be dead to the world after the last few days.
[2019-07-24, 5:14:28 PM] Rob Feeny: You tell me what time the train will get you to Sperling (or if there's an easier one like Braid)
[2019-07-24, 5:14:34 PM] Rob Feeny: And I'll be there to grab you
[2019-07-24, 5:14:42 PM] Rob Feeny: K I'll grab your stuff
[2019-07-24, 5:14:45 PM] Jamie: Thx
[2019-07-24, 5:17:39 PM] Jamie: I can be there by 7am
[2019-07-24, 5:21:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect
[2019-07-24, 5:26:46 PM] Jamie: Anything else I need? Is there a microwave on site for heating up food?
[2019-07-24, 5:27:26 PM] Rob Feeny: That is a very good question. I don't actually know
[2019-07-24, 5:28:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Ben is opposed to them but it's Tim's workshop. Tim is a Mennonite that shuns some technologies but not others
[2019-07-24, 5:36:47 PM] Rob Feeny: I also am waiting on a reply from Ben too so we don't make it there before him
[2019-07-24, 6:12:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok 7am at Sperling?
[2019-07-24, 6:12:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Or Braid?
[2019-07-24, 6:13:05 PM] Jamie: Sperling.
[2019-07-24, 6:13:23 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2019-07-25, 12:19:44 AM] Jamie: Hey what am happening for lunch tomorrow?
[2019-07-25, 12:19:51 AM] Jamie: what’s*
[2019-07-25, 12:20:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Good question. Last time I packed a bag lunch but there's also a Tim Hortons about eight minutes away
[2019-07-25, 12:21:01 AM] Jamie: Ok that works
[2019-07-25, 12:21:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Okay I'm crashing now see you in the morning
[2019-07-25, 7:46:23 AM] Jamie: Morning. Don’t forget to grab my tools!
[2019-07-25, 7:59:38 AM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻

[2019-07-25, 8:49:54 AM] Rob Feeny: We're a couple min behind, just making lunch
[2019-07-25, 9:03:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Granola is damn hard to eat quickly. Leaving in like 3 min
[2019-07-25, 9:03:13 AM] Jamie: Ok

[2019-07-25, 11:50:03 PM] Jamie: Ahh shit. Ok if I need it, I’ll come get it tomorrow, otherwise Tuesday
[2019-07-25, 11:50:20 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻
[2019-07-26, 11:32:48 AM] Jamie: Figure out the water pump?
[2019-07-26, 11:33:33 AM] Rob Feeny: No, was waiting until the RV supply place opened, just heading out there now
[2019-07-26, 11:33:42 AM] Rob Feeny: It's in Whistler so Tori and I are making a day of it
[2019-07-26, 11:33:49 AM] Jamie: Ah ok. Nice
[2019-07-26, 11:34:21 AM] Jamie: Wow. That single day of work took it out of me, lol
[2019-07-26, 11:34:57 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha I was going to message and ask how you were feeling
[2019-07-26, 11:35:06 AM] Rob Feeny: The shoulder?
[2019-07-26, 11:36:50 AM] Jamie: Pretty sore actually but not more than after any exercise.
[2019-07-26, 4:30:01 PM] Rob Feeny: well I had to drive all the way out to Whistler because these ladies ran out of water and couldn't figure that out but hey as a bonus the gas gauge suddenly started working in the van
[2019-07-26, 4:30:57 PM] Jamie: Holy fuck. How the hell did they run out of water in the first 2 days?
[2019-07-26, 4:31:37 PM] Jamie: In the bright side, at least it is fixed
[2019-07-26, 5:40:05 PM] Jamie: There is a girl beside me with a post it over her computer camera but nothing on her iPhone cameras. ???
[2019-07-26, 6:09:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha paranoia is selective?
[2019-07-26, 6:10:21 PM] Jamie: Guess so. People are sheep and follow. Nobody mentioned the iPhone camera in the buzzfeed article she read, lol
[2019-07-26, 8:07:50 PM] Jamie: Hey did you take any pics of that tiny house yesterday?
[2019-07-26, 8:43:48 PM] Rob Feeny: All I have, from a different day

[2019-07-27, 4:23:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Hanging out with Tori is like stepping outside of reality for a while
[2019-07-27, 9:03:39 PM] Rob Feeny: What are you up to tonight? Heading to Kits point to watch fireworks with Daniel and his gf at 8
[2019-07-27, 9:07:21 PM] Jamie: Meeting up with Zoe tonight actually but thanks for the invite.
[2019-07-27, 9:15:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok have a good one
[2019-07-30, 8:24:37 AM] Jamie: Bbq tonight? I’m heading to work with Ben but brought your mail and need to grab my jacket too
[2019-07-30, 8:25:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Sure, keep me posted on when you think you'll make it back, I'm working in the AM then heading to the Fortuga
[2019-07-30, 8:26:05 AM] Jamie: Will do. I imagine 7-7:30 but will update
[2019-07-30, 8:26:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2019-07-30, 7:41:25 PM] Jamie: Still here. Wanna just go to XSite?
[2019-07-30, 7:41:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure. I'm still working too.
[2019-07-30, 7:42:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Wasting time with a stupid fucking one-directional HDMI cord
[2019-07-30, 7:42:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Why would you ever sell that?!
[2019-07-30, 7:46:30 PM] Jamie: That does sound like a dumb idea

[2019-07-30, 7:47:19 PM] Rob Feeny: As a business owner on fixed price jobs, it's a money-loser
[2019-07-30, 7:54:47 PM] Jamie: You working tomorrow?
[2019-07-30, 7:56:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Mostly. Have to pick up the van super early at the airport, have a  meeting 9-11 then work 12 to 5
[2019-07-30, 7:56:40 PM] Jamie: Ahhh, Ben was wondering if you could work
[2019-07-30, 7:58:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Naw can't work at all this week, need to finish the truck and move it by Sunday
[2019-07-30, 7:58:52 PM] Jamie: How are you getting the van?
[2019-07-30, 8:00:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Transit
[2019-07-30, 8:01:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Gotta be at the airport for 4am. Whee. Lesson learned. Airport pickup is now $200
[2019-07-30, 8:03:31 PM] Jamie: Want me to drive you in your car?
[2019-07-30, 8:04:21 PM] Rob Feeny: At 3:20am? Are you open to that? I didn't even want to ask, it's a horrible time!
[2019-07-30, 8:05:20 PM] Rob Feeny: I asked if the lady was driving there from Squamish/Whistler in the am, and if she was, would she be open to picking me up along the way (at Hwy 1 & Hastings) and she replied "are you going to give me my $100 for airport pickup back?"
[2019-07-30, 8:05:27 PM] Rob Feeny: She's such a bitch. Fucking Quebecoise
[2019-07-30, 8:05:52 PM] Jamie: Tell her you will give it back if she drops the van off at the house, lol
[2019-07-30, 8:06:04 PM] Jamie: Yeah that’s fine I can drive you to the airport
[2019-07-30, 8:06:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha and she already used half of it when I brought it there for their flight here. So it was $50
[2019-07-30, 8:06:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks Jamie
[2019-07-30, 8:16:44 PM] Jamie: We are heading out
[2019-07-30, 8:19:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok give me at ETA and I'll be there. He going to drop you right at X site?
[2019-07-30, 8:19:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Or my place?
[2019-07-30, 8:19:30 PM] Jamie: Not sure yet. Probably your place, I have my tools, bag etc
[2019-07-30, 8:20:36 PM] Jamie: Your house
[2019-07-30, 8:20:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2019-07-30, 8:24:53 PM] Jamie: Actually I think Ben is going to come to excite so will meet you there. Will update ETA soon-ish
[2019-07-30, 8:25:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Perft
[2019-07-30, 8:32:03 PM] Jamie: 7:30ish eta
[2019-07-30, 8:34:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok see you then
[2019-07-30, 9:29:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm inside with a table
[2019-07-30, 9:29:42 PM] Jamie: Awesome we’re three minutes away
[2019-07-30, 9:29:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Cool. Burger night
[2019-07-30, 9:30:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Want me to order 3? Haha
[2019-07-30, 9:30:42 PM] Jamie: I think burgers are always 695
[2019-07-30, 9:31:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah the basic one is, I'll ask what is different with the "gourmet burger"
[2019-07-31, 5:52:14 AM] Jamie: All good?
[2019-07-31, 5:53:49 AM] Rob Feeny: All good
[2019-07-31, 10:39:32 AM] Jamie: I’m tired!
[2019-07-31, 10:39:47 AM] Jamie: But not too bad actually
[2019-07-31, 10:43:04 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm dragging ass haha
[2019-07-31, 11:37:51 AM] Jamie: Thanks for the vehicle this morning, sure helps me get on my little errands done
[2019-07-31, 12:31:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks in return mab
[2019-07-31, 12:31:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Man
[2019-07-31, 2:13:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Well I did my first group therapy class
[2019-07-31, 2:13:37 PM] Rob Feeny: It was interesting
[2019-07-31, 2:30:03 PM] Jamie: But good?
[2019-07-31, 2:30:11 PM] Jamie: I meant to ask about the meds too
[2019-07-31, 2:30:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, I can see the utility in it.
[2019-07-31, 2:30:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Honestly the meds seem pretty mild, I might try a stronger dose to get an idea of the effect (maybe go twice and strong then dial back)
[2019-07-31, 2:31:33 PM] Jamie: Totally different subject, any chance you left their chairs outside?
[2019-07-31, 2:31:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep they're outside the door
[2019-07-31, 2:34:59 PM] Jamie: Cool. I will leave your keys under the recycling container
[2019-07-31, 2:35:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect. Have fun
[2019-07-31, 9:20:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, just scored a 2 night rental this weekend that lets me pocket $450 I wasn't expecting
[2019-08-01, 12:13:00 AM] Rob Feeny: Don't by any chance have a key to my place still? I'm locked out and can't get ahold of Christian
[2019-08-01, 12:13:37 AM] Jamie: I don’t. Shit
[2019-08-01, 12:14:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha I have my laptop and my phone? And a camp chair ..
[2019-08-01, 12:14:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Might end up sleeping in the van
[2019-08-01, 12:59:16 AM] Jamie: Did you get in?
[2019-08-01, 1:01:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope I'm in the van
[2019-08-01, 1:01:30 AM] Rob Feeny: I forgot that Tori used my outside key
[2019-08-01, 1:02:03 AM] Jamie: Shit. At least you have that van back
[2019-08-01, 1:02:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha yup, I'm just worried he woke wake up before I have to work in the AM
[2019-08-01, 1:03:19 AM] Rob Feeny: That dude keeps weird hours and can sleep for like 15hrs
[2019-08-01, 1:03:59 AM] Jamie: Go into Ashtis room and pound on the wall
[2019-08-01, 1:04:18 AM] Rob Feeny: I don't have the key to Dan's, it's in my place
[2019-08-01, 1:04:27 AM] Rob Feeny: If the door isn't open I'll.knock on his window
[2019-08-01, 1:08:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Crashing. Night man
[2019-08-01, 10:53:52 AM] Jamie: Got into your place?
[2019-08-01, 12:07:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Eventually at 830 😭
[2019-08-01, 12:07:29 PM] Jamie: I see lots of evidence of your craftsmanship here. You do nice work
[2019-08-01, 12:07:28 PM] Rob Feeny: So tired
[2019-08-01, 12:07:40 PM] Rob Feeny: In the lights? Thanks!
[2019-08-01, 12:07:46 PM] Jamie: And the good fan
[2019-08-01, 12:07:48 PM] Rob Feeny: It was tricky work, hope you're having fun haha
[2019-08-01, 12:07:51 PM] Jamie: hood*
[2019-08-01, 12:08:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha that was a fun solution to find online
[2019-08-01, 12:08:29 PM] Jamie: I bet. Yah they are a pain but the wires are totally long enough. And he only had 4 so not bad
[2019-08-01, 12:09:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Might be doing an airstream later this year on salt spring island you're around
[2019-08-01, 12:09:31 PM] Rob Feeny: If
[2019-08-01, 12:09:57 PM] Jamie: It’s possible I will be in Vancouver in October.
[2019-08-01, 5:15:20 PM] Jamie: Thanks for the hook up with Van been BEN, nice little chunk of cash and some fun drone work
‎[2019-08-01, 5:15:26 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-08-01, 6:10:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha been fun?
[2019-08-01, 6:10:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks cool man!
[2019-08-01, 6:39:18 PM] Jamie: Driving in busy traffic makes me a horrible person, ha ha
[2019-08-01, 6:39:28 PM] Jamie: I hate all these people
[2019-08-01, 6:51:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha why are you doing the driving?
[2019-08-01, 6:58:38 PM] Jamie: I borrowed the metris so I wasn’t dependant on Ben to get home in time
[2019-08-01, 6:59:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh good call
‎[2019-08-01, 6:59:42 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-08-01, 6:59:46 PM] Rob Feeny: So close!
[2019-08-01, 7:00:13 PM] Jamie: It was hilarious. The guy besode me hypermileing in rush hour traffic was pissing so many people off. The Chinese lady changing her mind about turning and backing back out into night street, lol
[2019-08-01, 7:01:35 PM] Jamie: Looks pretty good!
[2019-08-01, 7:17:57 PM] Rob Feeny: I've got a ceiling!
[2019-08-01, 7:18:04 PM] Rob Feeny: So close...
‎[2019-08-01, 7:28:31 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-08-01, 7:29:17 PM] Jamie: Where are the led lights?
[2019-08-01, 7:31:22 PM] Rob Feeny: They'll be surface mount
[2019-08-01, 7:31:57 PM] Rob Feeny: And peel and stick 😅
[2019-08-01, 10:19:29 PM] Jamie: Same ones as the tiny house?
[2019-08-01, 10:19:57 PM] Rob Feeny: No, I'm going to use some cheaper LED strips
[2019-08-01, 10:20:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Just unroll them and stick them on
[2019-08-01, 10:20:09 PM] Jamie: Ahh ok
[2019-08-01, 10:20:16 PM] Jamie: From the corners?
[2019-08-01, 10:21:59 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll surface mount some wires with wire staples. It's a shop haha
[2019-08-01, 10:22:24 PM] Rob Feeny: The AC will just be BX surface mounted too with metal surface mount boxes
[2019-08-01, 10:22:33 PM] Jamie: (Shaking my head emoticon goes here)
[2019-08-01, 10:25:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha think workshop man!
[2019-08-01, 10:26:05 PM] Rob Feeny: With a battery under a work bench and the panel is a power bar
[2019-08-01, 10:26:48 PM] Jamie: Lol. Still needs a hot tub
[2019-08-01, 10:35:12 PM] Rob Feeny: And two sugar babies?
[2019-08-01, 10:35:40 PM] Rob Feeny: I finally unloaded on Morgan about not paying me while supporting two 'bonus' girls
[2019-08-01, 10:35:44 PM] Jamie: More like sugar gremlins
[2019-08-01, 10:36:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Got a $900 payment out of him and an agreement to pay me a minimum of $100 every Monday
[2019-08-01, 10:36:13 PM] Rob Feeny: He has invoices unpaid from January
[2019-08-01, 10:36:35 PM] Jamie: Well that’s something.
[2019-08-01, 10:37:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep it means he only owes me six grand
[2019-08-01, 10:37:52 PM] Jamie: It would be nice to get it as one lump sum
[2019-08-01, 10:38:02 PM] Jamie: Lol I woke Emilie up last night to get the key for the small van. And I was not nice about it
[2019-08-01, 10:38:29 PM] Jamie: And she drove it after you, it was so empty I had to get gas immediately
[2019-08-01, 10:38:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha sorry man
[2019-08-01, 10:39:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I also told Morgan and an that they're now on a 24% interest rate for any late payments
[2019-08-01, 10:39:24 PM] Jamie: It’s Morgan’s fault. Between owing you and having her as a dependant, people are going to do that
[2019-08-01, 10:39:37 PM] Rob Feeny: That's exactly yet he's supporting five people
[2019-08-01, 10:39:41 PM] Rob Feeny: It
[2019-08-01, 10:40:03 PM] Rob Feeny: so I'm taking any free lunch she'll give me but we went out last month and he paid for lunch for Emily and then gave her a hundred cash
[2019-08-01, 10:40:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry my voice-to-text sucks today
[2019-08-01, 10:40:33 PM] Jamie: I’m very good at deciphering thanks to Morgan
[2019-08-01, 10:40:52 PM] Jamie: I figure 4 of the cost of borrowing his vehicles all the time he’s worked off that shelter
[2019-08-01, 10:41:17 PM] Jamie: I’m so freaking tired though
[2019-08-01, 10:41:31 PM] Jamie: Once my nightmare of a rideshare is over tomorrow, I’ll be able to relax
[2019-08-01, 10:41:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha but ready for tomorrow?
[2019-08-01, 10:42:10 PM] Jamie: This guy has packed his tiny little two door Chevy with people and ignored my message about my luggage. I called him today and now he’s panicking that it might not all fit
[2019-08-01, 10:42:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Hope he gets a terrible review
[2019-08-01, 10:43:01 PM] Jamie: We will see if he drops me off at mom’s house or leaves me stranded downtown
[2019-08-01, 10:43:12 PM] Rob Feeny: I really like the review aspect because there are repercussions to his actions
[2019-08-01, 10:43:19 PM] Jamie: But I’m pretty sure I’m going to post that he was a very bad communicator
[2019-08-01, 10:44:51 PM] Rob Feeny: People will forgive a shity vehicle if you make the experience enjoyable
[2019-08-01, 10:47:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Every nightmare story makes me proud of my 24 five star reviews
[2019-08-01, 10:47:43 PM] Jamie: Yeah you have it figured out. This guy didn’t post the pick up or drop off locations, lol.  Wtf could be more important
[2019-08-01, 10:48:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh and the bitchie French girls gave me four out of five stars
[2019-08-01, 10:48:14 PM] Jamie: Any comments?
[2019-08-01, 10:51:18 PM] Rob Feeny: "thank you goe the fun experience we really had fun en enjoy it"
[2019-08-01, 10:51:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Errors included
[2019-08-01, 10:52:00 PM] Jamie: But only 4 stars. I’m sure she has been disappointed in every lover she every had, 😂
[2019-08-01, 10:58:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha and I even spotted her on tinder (lying about her age) that day
[2019-08-01, 11:00:57 PM] Jamie: Oh god.  Imagine your disappointment of that review, haha. “4 of 5 stars, tres bien fun, thanks you for good time”
[2019-08-01, 11:01:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha whatever she's gone and I have an extra freebie this weekend. 2 nights, $445 in my pocket
[2019-08-01, 11:02:11 PM] Jamie: That’s ridiculous.
[2019-08-01, 11:02:19 PM] Rob Feeny: 😄
[2019-08-01, 11:02:54 PM] Jamie: In taxes on that bitch
[2019-08-01, 11:03:03 PM] Jamie: Hope you are paying*
[2019-08-01, 11:04:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha I have spent so much on useless shit like the giant truck and restoring that van that I won't pay a penny in taxes this year
[2019-08-01, 11:05:38 PM] Rob Feeny: I write off almost my entire life
‎[2019-08-02, 1:07:03 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-08-02, 1:09:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha you're a professional homeless person!
‎[2019-08-02, 9:26:52 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-08-02, 9:27:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Come on where the ikea bags? Black garbage bags?
[2019-08-02, 9:39:50 AM] Jamie: Lol.
[2019-08-02, 9:49:24 AM] Jamie: This guy is something else. The pickup location is a Tim hortons with no parking near Metrotown. He is either going to have to park at Crystal Mall or pull up and put his hazards on to load
[2019-08-02, 9:50:19 AM] Jamie: 25 people driven. 🤷‍♂️
[2019-08-02, 10:12:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha and what's his rating?
[2019-08-02, 10:12:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Maybe he's an amazing guy who buys everyone coffee?
[2019-08-02, 10:12:58 AM] Jamie: 4.8 with 8 reviews.
[2019-08-02, 10:13:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow. Interesting tho, I have 24 reviews from I think 29 people driven
[2019-08-02, 10:13:22 AM] Jamie: I am holding out that he’s awesome but I brought banana walnut muffins from Kat just in case
[2019-08-02, 10:13:28 AM] Rob Feeny: "if you don't have something nice to say"
[2019-08-02, 10:13:52 AM] Jamie: Yeah I rarely leave a review. I know I should
[2019-08-02, 10:20:06 AM] Rob Feeny: It's their reward/punishment
[2019-08-02, 9:02:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Man, it feels good to have money coming in after so damn long without it. That $900 from Morgan came the same time as payments from Tim in Chilliwack, Tim the AV guy and RVezy
[2019-08-02, 9:02:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I was scraping the bottom of the barrel!
[2019-08-02, 9:02:51 PM] Rob Feeny: How did the trip go?
[2019-08-02, 9:27:35 PM] Jamie: Happy to hear mean
[2019-08-02, 9:27:38 PM] Jamie: Man
[2019-08-02, 9:28:04 PM] Jamie: Trip was pretty bad but it’s over
[2019-08-02, 9:29:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha crushed and sweaty?
[2019-08-02, 10:07:16 PM] Jamie: Totally.  And bad music, smelly people.
[2019-08-02, 10:11:27 PM] Rob Feeny: How many stars?
[2019-08-02, 10:13:59 PM] Jamie: I’m thinking 3.  Communication is important and he was frustrating to deal with
[2019-08-02, 10:16:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Good. Gotta let future people know!
[2019-08-03, 1:01:18 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob, if you are ever near Fairmont let me know. I’m pretty sure I left my GoPro in the van console and don’t want one of Morgan’s minions to steal it. The SD card is expensive too
[2019-08-03, 1:06:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, I'm borrowing the Metris tonight or tomorrow to grab some cupboards so it's perfect
[2019-08-03, 1:07:01 PM] Jamie: Awesome. Appreciate that. It might be in the lower console because I totally didn’t see it when I visually scanned the van
[2019-08-03, 1:07:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, I set an alarm to remind me
[2019-08-03, 4:42:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Oops

[2019-08-03, 8:18:29 PM] Jamie: Thanks. Don’t really need it but didn’t want to lose it
[2019-08-03, 8:20:03 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏻

[2019-08-03, 10:00:49 PM] Jamie: Lol. Classic
[2019-08-03, 10:01:01 PM] Jamie: What did you think of the video
[2019-08-03, 10:01:02 PM] Jamie: ?
[2019-08-03, 10:06:34 PM] Rob Feeny: The flyby and zoom in look great! I think the first shot from the front is too long... And that Ben needs a logo in white to overlay, it looks odd to be on a white square background
[2019-08-03, 10:19:15 PM] Jamie: Yeah I’ve shortened the intro lots and you’re right about the logo. But done is better than perfect!
[2019-08-03, 11:58:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha exactly
‎[2019-08-04, 12:25:11 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-08-04, 12:25:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Forgot something else in the Metris?
[2019-08-04, 12:29:17 PM] Jamie: Yeah I couldn’t carry it with the ride I had.
[2019-08-04, 12:30:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok want me to put it in my shed?
[2019-08-04, 12:30:34 PM] Jamie: That would be cool. Cheers
[2019-08-04, 12:30:38 PM] Jamie: Btw Just told Myles I’m done making plans with him. I think I am going to block him for the summer.
[2019-08-04, 12:31:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha he up to his usual tricks?
[2019-08-04, 12:32:19 PM] Jamie: He’s getting worse. Send me a message last night after ignoring my texts for two days about going to the beach after he suggested it, asking if I had plans for breakfast. I said no and that’s the last I heard from him. He has done that exact thing about five times now
[2019-08-04, 12:33:00 PM] Jamie: I’m not sure if we have plans, or don’t have plans or white. I don’t like being in a situation where I have to keep space open for someone like him
[2019-08-04, 12:33:49 PM] Jamie: But I don’t want to deal with all summer so I think will just block him so I know it’s not an option and won’t fall for it again if he reaches out.
[2019-08-04, 12:35:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Probably a good plan. He sounds like someone that just sucks at being considerate or planning. Don't waste your energy
[2019-08-04, 12:45:31 PM] Jamie: Yup
‎[2019-08-05, 12:11:56 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-08-05, 12:12:02 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd call that a solid week.
[2019-08-05, 12:17:46 PM] Jamie: Not bad at all!
[2019-08-08, 5:19:58 PM] Jamie: Any chance you’re going to see Ben soon? I accidentally took some of Morgan’s tools out and left them at the shop
[2019-08-08, 5:20:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah damn, I'm not sure when I'll see him but I can grab them off him at some point
[2019-08-09, 10:13:52 AM] Rob Feeny: How's Kelowna?
[2019-08-09, 10:15:02 AM] Jamie: It’s hot!  Pretty good, getting a rhythm down. Taking the dog to the beach everyday, lots of pretty girls with dogs there, not a bad life
[2019-08-09, 10:15:28 AM] Jamie: Vancouver still working too much?
[2019-08-09, 10:19:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice life! And yep, but slowly slowing down. Big truck went into storage last night, camper is out for about 11 days
[2019-08-09, 10:20:26 AM] Jamie: That’s good. Where is the Fortuga being stored?
[2019-08-09, 10:20:47 AM] Rob Feeny: For now, a lot out in Maple Ridge where we've built a Tiny House before
[2019-08-09, 10:21:42 AM] Jamie: Nice. And doing alright for money with the camper paying out?
[2019-08-09, 10:22:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah just got 1500 and have another 1200 on the way
[2019-08-09, 10:22:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha my motorcycle is trapped in the back of the Fortuga though as the rear lift gates topped working
[2019-08-09, 10:23:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Did you buy your new drone?
[2019-08-09, 10:23:27 AM] Jamie: Oh god.  Good thing you have 3
[2019-08-09, 10:23:59 AM] Jamie: Nope. Trying to get it used, proabably near the end of the summer when it’s not so nice
[2019-08-09, 10:24:31 AM] Jamie: I bought this -> https://www.dji.com/mobile/osmo-mobile-2
[2019-08-09, 10:24:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah and 2 aren't running.  Been to busy to fix them
[2019-08-09, 10:24:58 AM] Jamie: $120 used, good for 4x4 videos and other iPhone projects
[2019-08-09, 10:25:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice, my buddy suhk (part of the Visual Chemists) uses one regularly
[2019-08-09, 10:25:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Cool to watch it work
[2019-08-09, 10:26:43 AM] Jamie: Yeah the panorama feature is worth the $120 I paid. Takes 9 photos in a 3x3 grid to build a perfect aspect panorama. Just set it on a tripod and press go
[2019-08-09, 10:47:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Sweet, you can get some Olon shots
[2019-08-09, 10:48:16 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm so excited to have no responsibility tonight. I can do laundry and sleep
[2019-08-09, 10:48:28 AM] Jamie: Lol life goals!
[2019-08-11, 12:40:03 PM] Jamie: Hey can I order some stuff and have it delivered to moms on your Amazon Prime account? 😁
[2019-08-11, 12:40:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok..  it has to go on my card, I think. Send me the link?
[2019-08-11, 12:42:13 PM] Jamie: It’s a few things. That’s fine, you get the points and I can e-transfer. Small tripod, case for a gimbal and an iPhone cable. I have to settle on a case but I wonder if I can send you a link to my shopping cart?
[2019-08-11, 12:47:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure, I think the easiest way might be to add it to a wish list and send me that
[2019-08-11, 12:48:36 PM] Jamie: Ahh ok I will do that. Honestly still deciding if I want to keep the gimbal and part of the decision is how big the case is. So I have to buy the case to know, lol. I’m humming and hawing
[2019-08-11, 12:53:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok I'm about to take a nap so just keep me posted
[2019-08-11, 12:53:09 PM] Jamie: Ok
‎[2019-08-11, 8:27:58 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-08-11, 8:28:07 PM] Rob Feeny: This wouldn't be the one you know, would it?
[2019-08-11, 8:49:48 PM] Jamie: Yup. It was her birthday yesterday I think
[2019-08-11, 8:50:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha she's on all the dating sites out here, very recognizable name
[2019-08-14, 11:15:25 AM] Jamie: Hey dude, what happened with the van? Didn’t sound like you were too happy last night. A sleep help?
[2019-08-14, 11:16:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Somewhat. It's broken down again. In Banff. The renters are asking for a refund for 11 of their 14 days
[2019-08-14, 11:16:33 AM] Rob Feeny: They took a bus to Calgary and got a rental car
[2019-08-14, 11:19:06 AM] Jamie: So are they continuing to camp in it? But have to use the rental car to get around?
[2019-08-14, 6:46:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow. The towing from Lake Louise to Banff was $800
[2019-08-14, 6:49:55 PM] Jamie: Ouch
[2019-08-14, 6:50:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Was shocked when I saw that on my credit card as I'm still waiting for the invoice
[2019-08-14, 7:28:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh god. The girl I went on a date with on Sunday, I thought she blew me off but she died in a car accident later that day
[2019-08-14, 8:37:20 PM] Jamie: What the fuck
[2019-08-14, 11:54:38 PM] Jamie: How’s it going, Rob?
[2019-08-16, 4:03:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey man sorry I missed your call yesterday I'm doing a lot better now
[2019-08-16, 4:03:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I also got the tools from Ben that you left in the tiny house
[2019-08-16, 4:04:07 PM] Jamie: All good Rob. I was just calling to see how you are doing. Glad to hear you are feeling a bit better
[2019-08-16, 4:04:24 PM] Jamie: Thank you so much!  I was worried about that.
[2019-08-16, 4:05:16 PM] Rob Feeny: They think they have the van running for good now but we'll see 🤣
[2019-08-16, 4:06:02 PM] Rob Feeny: How does the planning over at Mom's?
[2019-08-16, 4:11:18 PM] Jamie: Really good actually. I scrapped the first design and built a much simpler one that doesn’t involve any work on the existing house except a single door to be a legal secondary suite. Put together an initial budget and it seems reasonable to build it for about $138k
[2019-08-16, 4:12:20 PM] Jamie: When I’m at my computer in a bit, I will send you a 3D photo. I’m super happy with the design, only 672 sq ft including the 60 sq ft patio
[2019-08-16, 4:13:01 PM] Jamie: And I’m going to be reaching out to the AV guys in the area to try to get back into lighting control programming. Not full time, just something to do
[2019-08-16, 4:13:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Very cool
[2019-08-16, 4:14:04 PM] Jamie: What was it?
[2019-08-16, 4:14:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Morgan might need help out here, i hear Davey put his notice in
[2019-08-16, 4:14:35 PM] Rob Feeny: The ignition coil pickup, a tiny little piece that sits under the distributor cap
[2019-08-16, 4:14:57 PM] Jamie: Shit, not good news for Morgan. Any idea why?
[2019-08-16, 4:15:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Inconsistent hours, Morgan not getting quotes out or doing his end of the business. Davey wants his commissions but Morgan hasn't had his head in the game and is just only responding to calls not building any business
[2019-08-16, 4:16:17 PM] Jamie: Is that what he said?
[2019-08-16, 4:16:31 PM] Rob Feeny: That's what he's been saying to me and Rolando
[2019-08-16, 4:16:40 PM] Rob Feeny: And then Rolando told me he got a good opportunity so...
[2019-08-16, 4:17:09 PM] Jamie: Well, I’m sure Morgan will survive
[2019-08-16, 4:18:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. In some form

[2019-08-16, 5:16:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, now with the garage in the front?
[2019-08-16, 5:19:32 PM] Jamie: Yeah if we face the other way, we need a 6m setback this way only 2.3m
[2019-08-16, 5:20:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Can you do it with the elevations?
[2019-08-16, 5:20:59 PM] Jamie: Yes. It was only when I tried to put the deck on the roof that everything had to line up. This way we only excavate to the frost line and end up at the same elevation
[2019-08-19, 5:44:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Huh. Despite me blowing through all the money I had set aside for paying taxes and all the money I've dumper into the big truck and the van, once I factor in the increased estimated value of those and the assets I'm slowly sprinkling around, my net worth actually increased about $500 between March and now
[2019-08-19, 5:44:58 PM] Rob Feeny: I was avoiding doing the financial snapshot for a while because I didn't want to know
[2019-08-19, 5:45:40 PM] Jamie: That’s pretty positive, Rob
[2019-08-19, 5:45:51 PM] Jamie: I know my net worth didn’t go out 500 bucks last month, ha ha
[2019-08-19, 5:47:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha yah buuuuuut how many hours did you work last month?
[2019-08-19, 5:50:04 PM] Jamie: Come on... at least 25 with Ben.
[2019-08-19, 5:50:57 PM] Jamie: Might have some drone work and smart home design work coming up
[2019-08-19, 5:51:06 PM] Jamie: And I reached out to some of the guys in down here to see if I can get some cool work
[2019-08-19, 5:56:43 PM] Jamie: So are you feeling a little bit better?
[2019-08-19, 6:01:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm looking at heading to the Okanagan early, maybe next Tuesday, before the long weekend
[2019-08-19, 6:01:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe get a couple of days of paragliding in before the long weekend
[2019-08-19, 6:06:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes, definitely. Spirits are up, exercise and diet are back to normal
[2019-08-19, 6:07:29 PM] Rob Feeny: It really was the hangover from sprinting too hard working without sleep and then the blow from all the lost income/costs of the van breaking down
[2019-08-19, 6:09:45 PM] Jamie: Fair enough. That would slow anyone down
[2019-08-19, 6:12:20 PM] Rob Feeny: I have a huge backlog of paperwork and bookkeeping to work through so I can do that from Kelowna/Lumby. The van goes out next Monday and comes back the following Monday night so I will be making money at least
[2019-08-19, 7:36:38 PM] Jamie: Sweet. So maybe next Tuesday you come here?
[2019-08-19, 7:39:43 PM] Rob Feeny: I think so. Maybe even Monday night. Just trying to sort what I would have to get done here first
[2019-08-20, 10:42:29 AM] Jamie: What a roller coaster… Hopefully one day you’ll look back at this and laugh
[2019-08-20, 8:02:57 PM] Jamie: Still on the side of the road?
[2019-08-20, 8:03:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Currently trying to hitchhike back to the van with a Jerry can of gas
[2019-08-20, 8:06:32 PM] Jamie: Is it seriously just out of gas?
[2019-08-20, 8:09:41 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a possibility. It shows about a tenth of a tank leftit's parked on slope. I haven't run it low on gas since the gauge started working again and it's possible that it's out of calibration
[2019-08-20, 8:09:52 PM] Rob Feeny: So when we change the pump
[2019-08-20, 8:10:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm slowly ruling out possibilities because it starts but won't keep going
[2019-08-20, 8:15:27 PM] Jamie: How hitchhiking working out?
[2019-08-20, 8:15:31 PM] Jamie: How is*
[2019-08-20, 8:15:44 PM] Rob Feeny: It's been tough but just got a ride. I'm only 8k out of town
[2019-08-20, 8:19:34 PM] Jamie: Oh good news, before it got dark
[2019-08-20, 8:22:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah but the gas didn't do the trick
[2019-08-21, 11:38:53 AM] Jamie: Hey Rob, where you at?
[2019-08-21, 11:39:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Merritt
[2019-08-21, 11:39:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Well, almost
[2019-08-21, 11:39:32 AM] Jamie: Same place?
[2019-08-21, 11:39:42 AM] Rob Feeny: About to try jumping it again then calling BCAA
[2019-08-21, 11:41:41 AM] Jamie: I thought BCAA wouldn’t come until tomorrow?
[2019-08-21, 11:42:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhhhh I listened to bad advice from a friend who said they make exceptions on the 48hrs
[2019-08-21, 11:42:31 AM] Rob Feeny: So I called and asked. Without giving my member number. But they used my phone number
[2019-08-21, 11:42:58 AM] Rob Feeny: And now it's in the system and they were clear that even tomorrow they won't honor the 320km range
[2019-08-21, 11:44:00 AM] Jamie: So how much?
[2019-08-21, 11:45:12 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll find out when I call in, but my estimate is an extra 350
[2019-08-21, 11:45:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Worked on the van troubleshooting until 10pm
[2019-08-21, 11:56:52 AM] Jamie: And any conclusions with the troubleshooting?
[2019-08-21, 11:57:47 AM] Rob Feeny: It's not getting fuel. Just taking off the brand new fuel filter to check it. Or maybe the brand new fuel pump failed
[2019-08-21, 11:58:02 AM] Rob Feeny: 🤯
[2019-08-21, 1:39:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha just noticed that some time since the renters took the van, someone popped out the debt in the right rear corner
[2019-08-21, 1:40:05 PM] Rob Feeny: *dent
[2019-08-21, 2:08:10 PM] Jamie: Well, bonus!
[2019-08-21, 9:51:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Well I don't think I'll be coming to Ktown early anymore
[2019-08-21, 9:51:19 PM] Rob Feeny: But maybe staying around after the long weekend
[2019-08-21, 9:53:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Probably heading up Friday noonish, stopping in Kelowna then off to the cabin
[2019-08-21, 11:14:08 PM] Jamie: Ok no worries
[2019-08-21, 11:21:28 PM] Jamie: Happy to sleep in your own bed tonight?
[2019-08-21, 11:49:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Hell yeah
[2019-08-22, 11:50:13 AM] Jamie: Hey any chance you can bring my drill case when you come?
[2019-08-22, 11:55:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok no worries.
[2019-08-22, 11:55:26 AM] Jamie: Thx.
[2019-08-22, 6:03:41 PM] Rob Feeny: There are few things worse than a hairdresser that doesn't listen to you
[2019-08-22, 6:03:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Went in for a cut, basically have short hair now
[2019-08-23, 12:53:42 PM] Jamie: Oh shit
[2019-08-23, 5:00:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Like 20cm off
[2019-08-24, 11:37:46 AM] Rob Feeny: https://www.castanet.net/news/Vernon/264315/Butter-Tart-Fest-today
[2019-08-24, 11:37:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Your personal heaven!
[2019-08-24, 1:47:37 PM] Jamie: Thanks for the tip Rob, I might just make that happen

[2019-08-24, 1:59:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Amazing!
[2019-08-24, 1:59:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I quite enjoyed that farmer's market
[2019-08-24, 1:59:56 PM] Rob Feeny: There's a lady there that sells awesome peach salsa
[2019-08-24, 2:06:22 PM] Jamie: That was perfect, we were about five minutes away I managed to swing by and I got three different types of butter tart. When I get home you’ll find me asleep on the couch in my underwear with butter tart crumbs all over
[2019-08-24, 2:06:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha oh you didn't know about it in advance? Awesome
[2019-08-26, 10:48:46 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm just bringing your drill case and GoPro right?
[2019-08-26, 10:53:10 AM] Jamie: That would great
[2019-08-26, 2:55:28 PM] Jamie: Looking forward to the weekend?
[2019-08-26, 3:04:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Definitely. Getting there is stressing me out though. The check engine light is on in my car and the camper, well it's just a clusterfuck
[2019-08-26, 3:06:05 PM] Jamie: Shit, have you made sure the gas cap is tightened?
[2019-08-26, 3:06:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yes. And all fluids are good
[2019-08-29, 12:09:28 PM] Rob Feeny: It bothers me a lot that Morgan has money to take his two mistresses on vacation to Kelowna, go boating etc for like a week long trip, but not to pay me

[2019-08-29, 6:14:11 PM] Jamie: Haha nice. That’s a good one
[2019-08-29, 6:14:52 PM] Jamie: The idiot twins? The autistic squirrel and the needy pug? Just spent the day 4x4ing and I want to drown them
[2019-08-29, 6:19:03 PM] Jamie: And yeah it’s pretty rude
[2019-08-29, 6:19:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahahaha want to hear something funny?
[2019-08-29, 6:19:18 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-08-29, 6:19:19 PM] Rob Feeny: The girl in seeing right now used to babysit Kyla
[2019-08-29, 6:19:29 PM] Jamie: Lol

[2019-08-29, 7:13:21 PM] Jamie: That’s pastil lake
[2019-08-29, 7:13:33 PM] Jamie: A 9 photo panorama
[2019-08-30, 12:33:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Waiting for set up, launch is occupied
[2019-09-05, 5:11:07 PM] Jamie: Van made it home ok?
[2019-09-05, 5:16:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep! Ran like a champ
[2019-09-05, 5:18:46 PM] Jamie: Good to hear
[2019-09-05, 5:26:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah it was nice, less stress for once
[2019-09-05, 5:26:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Hit a lot of rain though and man, she's hard to handle in the wind
[2019-09-05, 5:27:04 PM] Jamie: I bet. Those shocks are loose
[2019-09-05, 5:30:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah and she catches wind like a giant sail

[2019-09-07, 12:42:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Interesting. What book is that from?
[2019-09-07, 12:43:12 PM] Jamie: It’s called the 4 tendencies and it’s fascinating actually.

[2019-09-07, 12:47:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. Quite a lot, actually
[2019-09-08, 8:08:19 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd like to get back into tracking my hours with Toggl. You in?
[2019-09-08, 8:12:22 PM] Jamie: I don’t think so. For myself it doesn’t matter and I’m not really looking for accountability these days, lol
[2019-09-08, 8:18:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok understandable
[2019-09-09, 10:52:49 AM] Jamie: Hey do you know any cheap logo people? I have a pretty simple logo that I want made but I kind a want it to look like comic book drawn style
[2019-09-09, 10:53:41 AM] Rob Feeny: No, sorry. That one's always a struggle
[2019-09-09, 10:54:19 AM] Jamie: Ok thx
[2019-09-09, 11:00:12 AM] Rob Feeny: You're not using my hosting package for anything right? Just updating security and about to change the password
[2019-09-09, 11:00:51 AM] Jamie: Nothing that I need access to. Just a website I started and never finished
[2019-09-09, 11:03:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2019-09-11, 10:07:20 AM] Jamie: How things?
[2019-09-11, 10:07:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Decently. A week off install work to sort out Ben's bookkeeping
[2019-09-11, 10:07:52 AM] Rob Feeny: How are you?
[2019-09-11, 10:07:54 AM] Jamie: Making progress?
[2019-09-11, 10:08:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Slowly. He's totally disorganized and doesn't understand some very basic things about computers
‎[2019-09-11, 10:08:49 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-11, 10:08:58 AM] Rob Feeny: He'll log things like that as a receipt
[2019-09-11, 10:09:32 AM] Jamie: Lol. Maybe just a trigger to remember later to track it down. Far from a good system
[2019-09-11, 10:09:46 AM] Jamie: What software are you entering it into?
[2019-09-11, 10:10:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah. I built him a whole system and taught him how to use it but I think he's forgotten
[2019-09-11, 10:10:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Zoho Books
[2019-09-11, 10:12:14 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm in bed working while Tori sleeps on my couch
[2019-09-11, 10:13:00 AM] Jamie: Is Zoho pretty good? I have a no income year and I need to start doing it myself
[2019-09-11, 10:13:04 AM] Jamie: How’s tori,
[2019-09-11, 10:13:07 AM] Jamie: ?
[2019-09-11, 10:13:14 AM] Rob Feeny: It's decent and way cheaper
[2019-09-11, 10:13:30 AM] Rob Feeny: And you get pretty much 24/7 online tech support
[2019-09-11, 10:14:11 AM] Rob Feeny: Tori's actually doing pretty well. She had a friend visit here for a week, they stayed here Monday night before her flight out and we all made dinner
‎[2019-09-11, 10:14:19 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-11, 10:14:56 AM] Rob Feeny: How's Kelowna?
[2019-09-11, 10:17:36 AM] Jamie: Nice! Is she still living in her car?
[2019-09-11, 10:17:52 AM] Jamie: Cologne is pretty good, I went for the first run with the Lululemon run club last night, it was great
[2019-09-11, 10:19:00 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep, headed back to Ontario soon because she's out of money
[2019-09-11, 10:19:13 AM] Rob Feeny: I bet! I can imagine that crowd
[2019-09-11, 10:22:23 AM] Jamie: Can’t say I feel in good shape though
[2019-09-11, 10:22:46 AM] Jamie: It’s taken a while to find some people to run with
[2019-09-11, 10:27:28 AM] Rob Feeny: And running solo doesn't do it for you?
[2019-09-11, 10:28:02 AM] Jamie: Not really. I can sometimes run the waterfront on a Saturday if it’s busy but anything longer than about 5K and I’m bored if I’m not with people
[2019-09-11, 10:35:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Do you run with music?
[2019-09-11, 10:36:39 AM] Jamie: No I don’t. Might help?
[2019-09-11, 10:40:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah it really helps me. Keeps my mind occupied and the steady beat keeps me going
[2019-09-11, 10:41:10 AM] Jamie: Maybe I will try it. I have runs Tuesday, Wednesday, Sat and Sunday I can do now with people so might not need it. Need to stop eating such crappy food!!
[2019-09-11, 10:49:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha you're getting lazy living at home
[2019-09-11, 10:50:00 AM] Jamie: Very true. I made a slow cooker batch yesterday so I have good food for a week. Anything exciting happening in the next while?
[2019-09-11, 10:51:08 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice, I did one last week. Pork Curry
[2019-09-11, 10:51:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm might take the camper out this weekend with a friend
[2019-09-11, 10:51:31 AM] Rob Feeny: Otherwise pretty chill. Lots of paperwork
[2019-09-11, 10:51:34 AM] Rob Feeny: You?
[2019-09-11, 10:52:01 AM] Jamie: Sounds pretty economical
[2019-09-11, 10:53:05 AM] Jamie: Nah just working out some stuff for surfing videos when I get to Ecuador. Hit a few bylaws with the build here and may not be able to get around them. Sucks but 🤷‍♂️
[2019-09-11, 11:06:38 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh yeah? Like what?
[2019-09-11, 11:07:49 AM] Jamie: The driveway is in the wrong place. Put in without a permit by the original owner. If I pull a building permit, we have to move it back along Smithson  7m
[2019-09-11, 11:09:27 AM] Jamie: But... if we turn the garage entry towards smithson, there is a 6m setback from the property line which only leaves me about 3m to build. And I need about 7m depth.
[2019-09-11, 11:10:37 AM] Jamie: I went to the city to ask about a variance and they said for $1500 and 5 months of waiting I can ask the city council, but that the city planning staff had never supported a variance of the 6m setback and wouldn’t support mine 🙁
[2019-09-11, 11:11:30 AM] Jamie: The only option left is to take the driveway to the lane which would involve about $20k worth of driveway and landscaping and cut the backyard by 40%
[2019-09-11, 1:39:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh that sucks, sorry to hear it man
[2019-09-13, 10:37:04 AM] Jamie: Kind of a downer post in the group WhatsApp, you alright?
[2019-09-13, 10:45:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah just tired
[2019-09-13, 10:45:42 AM] Rob Feeny: It was meant to be joking. I was half awake
[2019-09-13, 10:49:13 AM] Jamie: Ah ok. Just checking to see how you’re doing 👍
[2019-09-13, 10:53:57 AM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man
[2019-09-13, 10:54:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Pretty decent actually. How about you?
[2019-09-13, 10:56:58 AM] Jamie: I think I’m hung over.  Good live band on a rooftop with Tana, Jeff, Laura and her roommate
[2019-09-13, 10:57:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh sweet, saw that on insta
[2019-09-13, 11:00:15 AM] Jamie: It was an over $100 night which hurts but I don’t do Jerry after
[2019-09-13, 11:00:25 AM] Jamie: it often*
‎[2019-09-13, 11:07:15 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-13, 11:07:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh yeah but you know quickly they get destroyed in Vancouver
[2019-09-13, 11:07:56 AM] Rob Feeny: People can be shitty
[2019-09-13, 11:08:19 AM] Jamie: Right? And how many needles could you hide in these plush bad boys
[2019-09-13, 11:08:44 AM] Rob Feeny: one of the good things that will come of our scary surveillance state is the fact that people will no longer be able to get away with shit like that
[2019-09-13, 11:10:04 AM] Jamie: Well they will get away with the act but get caught afterwards. Not always do they care about the consequences. Like kamikaze pilots, so hard to stop
[2019-09-13, 11:10:35 AM] Jamie: Busy Friday?
[2019-09-13, 11:15:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep, headed out to UBC to get a ticket to a climbing event
[2019-09-13, 11:18:17 AM] Jamie: Cool. I’m gonna have a nap after my morning coffee, haha
[2019-09-13, 11:21:58 AM] Rob Feeny: It must be nice to be an old retired dude!
[2019-09-13, 11:22:53 AM] Jamie: So far so good.
[2019-09-13, 11:23:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Emphasis on the old
[2019-09-13, 11:24:11 AM] Jamie: Feeling that way this morning for sure. Bones a creakin’!
[2019-09-13, 11:26:00 AM] Rob Feeny: Me too. I bruised my patella paragliding
[2019-09-13, 11:26:09 AM] Rob Feeny: It'll hurt for a while
[2019-09-13, 11:26:21 AM] Rob Feeny: And had so much sex yesterday it almost killed me
[2019-09-13, 11:26:27 AM] Jamie: Ouch. Yeah we never heard about your flying the next day. Successful landing?
[2019-09-13, 11:26:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha only 4 flights in 2 days :( All short. One rough landing on the field
[2019-09-13, 11:26:50 AM] Jamie: Well take it easy on that hand today then 😂
[2019-09-13, 11:27:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha Sheila left and Tori came over
[2019-09-13, 11:27:10 AM] Rob Feeny: Sadly tho, no sex with Tori
[2019-09-13, 11:27:22 AM] Rob Feeny: She's Just so nice to have around
[2019-09-13, 11:27:23 AM] Jamie: Who’s Sheila?
[2019-09-13, 11:27:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh a girl I've been seeing. Married in an open relationship, has a wife
[2019-09-13, 11:27:48 AM] Rob Feeny: 27, cute and puts in serious effort
[2019-09-13, 11:28:24 AM] Jamie: Pics?

[2019-09-13, 12:51:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha wow
[2019-09-13, 12:51:25 PM] Rob Feeny: You have to remember that in India that's probably a pro-level logo lol
[2019-09-13, 12:52:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Gotta be super specific. You were more looking for a stylized line drawing?
[2019-09-13, 12:52:47 PM] Jamie: No a 3D logo. I might go hand drawn to ensure I don’t get photoshop results
[2019-09-13, 12:53:38 PM] Jamie: I will give him the option to actually create something before I request either someone else or a refund
[2019-09-13, 12:53:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you check out his portfolio?
[2019-09-13, 12:54:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Upwork tends to have better freelancers but it's more expensive
[2019-09-13, 12:54:24 PM] Jamie: Yeah and they are all 3D model based logos
[2019-09-13, 12:56:02 PM] Jamie: We will see what happens. My first attempt for online freelance work
[2019-09-13, 12:56:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha it's very hit and miss
‎[2019-09-14, 7:54:06 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-14, 7:54:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Finally did the wires in the shed
[2019-09-14, 7:58:30 PM] Jamie: Nice. About time slacker
[2019-09-14, 7:59:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeahhhhh I know
[2019-09-14, 7:59:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Borrowed a wire stapler and tomorrow I'm heading out to truck to wire up my new lights and bring a load of salvage gear I have stored in the shed out there
[2019-09-14, 8:01:04 PM] Jamie: Sweet. Mobile shop getting close to finished?
[2019-09-14, 8:02:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Getting there. Bringing one more cupboard, installing my air vents and light system. Then just organizing and moving stuff in. Also setting up the bed tomorrow
[2019-09-14, 8:03:13 PM] Jamie: Send me pics when it’s installed. You gonna sleep there tomorrow?
[2019-09-14, 8:05:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope, work Monday AM but I have extra sheets, mattress protector, blankets etc so why not? I'm actually taking the camper there tomorrow so o can transport large items
[2019-09-14, 8:05:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Dishwasher is headed there too and my under-stair storage will be empty
[2019-09-14, 8:06:15 PM] Jamie: Be nice to clear that out so you can fill it up again, lol
[2019-09-14, 8:07:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha you know me well. But while it's empty it's getting painted. I think I'm making it the camper item storage area
‎[2019-09-15, 12:13:59 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-15, 12:32:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man.
[2019-09-15, 12:32:47 PM] Rob Feeny: I usually try to be very specific, they never take any initiative, so I provide 3-4 examples of logos I like
[2019-09-15, 12:33:32 PM] Jamie: Yup did all that too. His English seems good but he just doesn’t have any talent, lol.
[2019-09-15, 12:34:11 PM] Rob Feeny: That's exactly it. He's probably brand new. And very likely has stolen pictures for his portfolio.
[2019-09-15, 12:40:00 PM] Jamie: Probably true. I sent a request to cancel. See what happens. Got another person who will make the 3D model itself then I can try to get someone to create the logo from it.
[2019-09-15, 5:12:45 PM] Rob Feeny: What size wire should I be running to power a 5m LED strip?
[2019-09-15, 5:13:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Converter is about 5m away
[2019-09-15, 5:13:04 PM] Jamie: 12v?
[2019-09-15, 5:13:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes
[2019-09-15, 5:13:31 PM] Jamie: #16 should be fine
[2019-09-15, 5:13:36 PM] Rob Feeny: The online tool I used seemed to be out to lunch, I know Tim uses 16ga
[2019-09-15, 5:13:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, it was telling me 8ga
[2019-09-15, 5:13:57 PM] Jamie: Haha that’s crazy. What’s the amperage?
[2019-09-15, 5:14:17 PM] Rob Feeny: The info I can find about the strips say a string is 2a
[2019-09-15, 5:14:29 PM] Rob Feeny: And I wanted to power 2 strips from one wire
[2019-09-15, 5:14:46 PM] Rob Feeny: So 4a DC
[2019-09-15, 5:14:51 PM] Jamie: Even that should be fine.
[2019-09-15, 5:15:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok sweet. Workshop lighting time.
[2019-09-15, 5:15:41 PM] Jamie: Awesome
[2019-09-15, 5:17:06 PM] Rob Feeny: In an SMRT moment, I brought the wrong truck keys and can't open the rear rolling door (it only opens with a key?!) And can't bring in one cupboard I brought to site because it's too wide for the other door
[2019-09-15, 5:17:27 PM] Rob Feeny: 🤦🏼‍♂
[2019-09-15, 5:17:50 PM] Jamie: Oh shit. Lol. I’m sure you can take it apart with a hammer and glue it back together. You’re handy!
[2019-09-15, 5:19:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha Yah that's fine carpentry at it's best!
[2019-09-15, 5:23:51 PM] Jamie: It’s a workshop 🤷‍♂️
[2019-09-15, 5:25:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah but honestly it's made of particle board, it'd be garbage if I took it apart
[2019-09-15, 6:44:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Next time you need to use PopaRide I have 3x $5 promo codes
[2019-09-15, 6:44:44 PM] Jamie: Nice. I will need one to go to Vancouver.
[2019-09-15, 6:46:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I keep getting them for referring people but never take rides, just give them

[2019-09-15, 6:46:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Hehe
[2019-09-15, 6:47:06 PM] Jamie: Code violation!
[2019-09-15, 6:47:32 PM] Rob Feeny: What? You can't use box extensions by themselves?!
[2019-09-15, 6:47:56 PM] Jamie: For low voltage you can do aaaaaanything, lol
[2019-09-15, 6:48:10 PM] Jamie: But not with high voltage
‎[2019-09-15, 6:48:21 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-15, 6:48:28 PM] Rob Feeny: That's safeish right?
[2019-09-15, 6:48:37 PM] Jamie: That’s ballsy is what it is
[2019-09-15, 6:48:54 PM] Jamie: Stapler?
[2019-09-15, 6:49:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep
[2019-09-15, 6:49:54 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a shop...
[2019-09-15, 6:53:18 PM] Rob Feeny: It's 16/2 jobber audio cable, the sheathing is damn tough
[2019-09-15, 6:53:56 PM] Jamie: I remember trying it on a job, with cat five and stabbing holes through it and thinking… It will be fine
[2019-09-15, 6:54:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha
[2019-09-15, 6:54:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Yahhhh i have a stapler for that
[2019-09-15, 6:54:55 PM] Rob Feeny: It's got a nice little pocket to tuck the wire into before pulling the trigger.
[2019-09-15, 6:56:43 PM] Rob Feeny: This site is nice to work at, I can pee off the back deck of the truxk
[2019-09-15, 6:59:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Where's the cheapest place to buy profile to mount LED light strips on? This stuff won't stick
[2019-09-15, 7:01:50 PM] Jamie: At the led place, corner of Boundary and 1st. But we used marine glue or construction glue (might eventually eat through) to put it up
[2019-09-15, 7:01:59 PM] Jamie: What’s the construction glue called?
[2019-09-15, 7:02:04 PM] Rob Feeny: PL
[2019-09-15, 7:02:14 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-09-15, 7:02:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Messy shit. Might just use silicon.
[2019-09-15, 7:02:37 PM] Jamie: Yeah that works too but not very tacky for long runs by yourself
[2019-09-15, 7:02:39 PM] Rob Feeny: But I'd glue it to a thin profile of some sort on the ground then put that up, it's quite visible
[2019-09-20, 12:00:54 PM] Jamie: Flights are booked. Got awesome ones, glad I waited! Woke up in the middle of the night worrying I wouldn’t be able to get food flights, lol
[2019-09-20, 12:16:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha what did they cost?
[2019-09-20, 12:17:04 PM] Jamie: Used the last of my CC points. But to pay probably $1100
[2019-09-20, 12:23:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow... Ouch. That the cheapest you'd get there for?
[2019-09-20, 12:24:19 PM] Jamie: On points yes. No maneuvering booking through RBC Avion. I’m sure I could get better cash deals next time
[2019-09-21, 11:27:28 AM] Jamie: Hey you buying T-shirt’s at Walmart? My two black gap T-shirt’s are getting blown out at the neck
[2019-09-21, 11:27:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah the $5 ones are actually pretty decent if you can find a small (they're often sold out)
[2019-09-21, 11:33:01 AM] Jamie: Ok I will check it out. Stressful day yesterday buying the drone. The one guy from Brazil showed up 1.5 hrs late to the house with no text until he was on his way. Then he had left the 128GB card at home. When I told him we needed to renegotiate, he packed up and left, said I questioned his honesty, lol.
[2019-09-21, 11:33:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha and did you buy it or walk away?
[2019-09-21, 11:33:42 AM] Jamie: The second guy took my offer, drive to the house and we tested it and everything was there, done in less than an hour.
[2019-09-21, 11:33:50 AM] Jamie: He wouldn’t let me
[2019-09-21, 11:33:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha good. Fuck the Brazilian guy
[2019-09-21, 11:34:05 AM] Rob Feeny: It was probably stolen
[2019-09-21, 11:34:37 AM] Jamie: Yeah there doesn’t seem to be a way to check, which is crazy
[2019-09-21, 11:35:44 AM] Jamie: The one I got was a good deal. $850 for a drone that still sells for $1349
‎[2019-09-21, 11:37:43 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-21, 11:38:20 AM] Jamie: With taxes, maintenance and insurance plus an estimated 7% loss per year it doesn’t seem like a good deal
[2019-09-21, 11:39:51 AM] Rob Feeny: You could try to rent it during the months your gone... I think it comes down to it removing a stressor when you return and improving your quality of like when you're here
[2019-09-21, 11:41:11 AM] Jamie: This is true. I think it will be hard renting something decent for 6 months of the year. Wanna manage it on RVezy while I’m gone? 😁
[2019-09-21, 11:46:14 AM] Rob Feeny: For cut, I probably could haha
[2019-09-21, 11:46:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Just the parking for when it's not rented could be tricky
[2019-09-21, 11:47:14 AM] Jamie: I would imagine 50% after expenses
[2019-09-21, 11:47:35 AM] Rob Feeny: What are you looking to buy?
[2019-09-21, 11:47:43 AM] Jamie: Ain’t that the truth. I think about even coming and visiting Dan with it would be a hassle
[2019-09-21, 11:48:29 AM] Jamie: A class B. It really doesn’t make sense to buy anything over $55,000 so that might not be viable unless we get into either nine years old
[2019-09-21, 11:49:10 AM] Jamie: I need some real life examples that I can see and put into my spreadsheet
[2019-09-21, 11:49:30 AM] Jamie: It would have to be a really good deal with some comparables
[2019-09-21, 11:52:52 AM] Jamie: https://www.autotrader.ca/a/forest%20river/sunseeker/delta/british%20columbia/5_37012630_20180123142741465/?ms=rv&showcpo=ShowCpo&ncse=no&ursrc=ppl&pc=V1Y%207C1&sprx=-2
[2019-09-21, 11:53:20 AM] Jamie: Love the setup of this one with the full length slideout
[2019-09-21, 11:57:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Very cool. Bad data here, can't really load the pics tho. One thing to look at is the kms, the rentals get a LOT of use in a very short time
[2019-09-21, 11:58:25 AM] Jamie: And not owner use. I don’t like the big logo either but the layout I thought was sweet for a 26’.
[2019-09-21, 11:58:29 AM] Jamie: Where are you?
[2019-09-21, 12:16:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Daniel's cabin on Gambier
‎[2019-09-21, 12:16:15 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-21, 12:18:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Fetching water from the well
‎[2019-09-21, 12:18:35 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-21, 12:52:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice looking rig. Quite a bit of space!
[2019-09-21, 1:16:40 PM] Jamie: Crazy! On the end of the dock?
[2019-09-21, 1:17:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha no, no, that's just where the water taxi drops you off
[2019-09-21, 1:17:44 PM] Jamie: Looked a little cozy
‎[2019-09-21, 1:38:22 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
‎[2019-09-21, 1:41:46 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-21, 1:42:26 PM] Jamie: Wow. Looks awesome. What’s the view off the deck?
‎[2019-09-21, 1:59:19 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-21, 2:05:52 PM] Jamie: Love it
[2019-09-24, 6:28:39 PM] Jamie: Did they get anything out of the car?
[2019-09-24, 6:32:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Not a thing, as far as I can see.
[2019-09-24, 6:32:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Opened the box on the back seat and then ran
[2019-09-24, 6:33:40 PM] Jamie: I guess that’s better than any other option except for them not smashing your fucking window!!
[2019-09-24, 6:33:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Fuckers. At least it was only $200 for a new one
[2019-09-24, 6:34:20 PM] Jamie: That’s not bad considering
[2019-09-24, 6:35:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Which I can write off
[2019-09-24, 6:35:47 PM] Rob Feeny: But still. Pain in the effing asa
[2019-09-24, 6:39:47 PM] Jamie: Totally
[2019-09-24, 6:40:11 PM] Jamie: Looks like I’m going to buy a travel trailer for next summer. Way more room inside and quite a bit cheaper
[2019-09-24, 6:40:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha nice and get someone to move it for you?
[2019-09-24, 6:42:20 PM] Jamie: Yes. Dave has a couple of pick up trucks that can total any travel trailer up to about 30 feet
[2019-09-24, 6:42:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Total them hey? 🤣 sounds like Dave kinda trucks
[2019-09-24, 6:43:05 PM] Jamie: We will put it parallel to Smithson inside the yard immediately next to the hedges and back it in through Dave’s parking spot next to the carport
[2019-09-24, 6:43:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Sounds like you're all set
[2019-09-24, 6:43:55 PM] Jamie: A couple of slide outs… And awning… A propane campfire… haha living in the backyard
[2019-09-24, 6:44:27 PM] Rob Feeny: And I think the bylaws give you enough time before they kick in .
[2019-09-24, 6:44:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Just got to make sure you don't piss the neighbors off
[2019-09-24, 6:45:53 PM] Jamie: What were the byelaws again?
[2019-09-24, 6:48:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Living in an RV full time on a property
[2019-09-24, 6:48:24 PM] Rob Feeny: I think it's a 3 month max
[2019-09-24, 6:48:57 PM] Jamie: Wow I’m surprised they give you even that. The idea is to hide it in there and if somebody comes by I’ll just say it’s a guest house or something
[2019-09-24, 6:49:03 PM] Jamie: But yes don’t piss off the neighbours
[2019-09-24, 6:49:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Depends on the municipality. It's the tiny house problem. They're RVs in the eyes of the law, RVs are not permanent dwellings
[2019-09-24, 6:51:34 PM] Rob Feeny: They allow use for things like home renovations and restorations, visiting guests
[2019-09-24, 6:56:28 PM] Jamie: It would probably be heat score when the pump out service comes to take away my gray and black water, ha ha
[2019-09-24, 6:57:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahah  probably. Get Dave's mexicans to put in a sewer tie-in for you
[2019-09-24, 6:57:23 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a service access like outside my place
[2019-09-24, 6:57:26 PM] Rob Feeny: riht? haha
[2019-09-24, 7:00:04 PM] Jamie: Lol exactly
[2019-09-24, 7:00:25 PM] Rob Feeny: It's actually legit. My buddy Andy put one in for his RV
[2019-09-24, 7:00:46 PM] Rob Feeny: The plumber put one outside my door when we had to auger my sewer line and replace a section
[2019-09-24, 7:00:53 PM] Jamie: The sewer line comes in from the front yard in the middle
[2019-09-24, 7:01:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Damnit
[2019-09-24, 7:01:53 PM] Jamie: Yeah but it an interesting idea, I’ll work it into the plan somehow 😎
[2019-09-24, 7:01:54 PM] Rob Feeny: They make rolling tanks that go under the RV to take extra waste, you could use one of those and just take it somewhere to empty it
[2019-09-24, 7:02:39 PM] Jamie: Yeah that’s what dad said. Honestly I don’t see an issue with having someone pump it other than the neighbours.
[2019-09-24, 7:08:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah and the tank size. Will you be showering in it?
[2019-09-24, 7:08:46 PM] Rob Feeny: My tank gives me 20min tops in the shower at max, maybe 30ish if I have it partway on, before the tank is full
[2019-09-24, 7:09:14 PM] Rob Feeny: say you shower for 8min (not long at all) that means you'll be pumping it out probably twice a month
[2019-09-24, 7:09:15 PM] Jamie: Ideally yes. Everything. How bigs your feet water?
[2019-09-24, 7:09:33 PM] Jamie: Grey*
[2019-09-24, 7:10:04 PM] Jamie: Also, most have an outdoor shower hehe
[2019-09-24, 7:10:21 PM] Rob Feeny: I have a 160L  combo grey/black
[2019-09-24, 7:10:37 PM] Rob Feeny: RV showerhead is about 6L a minute
[2019-09-24, 7:11:22 PM] Jamie: Ok good numbers to have. Really would help to have a sewers tie in
[2019-09-24, 7:12:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Totally
[2019-09-24, 7:13:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Sheila and Katie are here, time to go for ice cream, have fun
[2019-09-24, 7:13:14 PM] Jamie: Later
[2019-09-25, 11:44:08 AM] Rob Feeny: I really really really regret signing on to handle Ben's books. What a fucking nightmare
[2019-09-25, 11:45:13 AM] Jamie: I bet. The man has talents but not with that
[2019-09-25, 11:45:34 AM] Rob Feeny: Between him not understand the basics of bookkeeping (what is a receipt vs what is a packing slip, he thinks any paper he's given works as a receipt) to him not understanding most of the basics of how a computer works (he can't understand that saving an entire webpage to a note isn't the same as taking a screenshot)
[2019-09-25, 11:45:39 AM] Rob Feeny: it's killing me
[2019-09-25, 11:48:05 AM] Jamie: Jesus. Is he just sloppy or he really doesn’t know?
[2019-09-25, 11:52:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Both. He doesn't understand anything that has to be 'right' or perfect. Everything is on a gradient to him and he doesn't see the utility
[2019-09-25, 11:52:42 AM] Jamie: Frustrating. Imagine him as an employee 😬
[2019-09-25, 11:53:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh man. I just keep sending things back to him, he'll screenshot a summary of a plane ticket and call it a receipt, but it has nothing but the total and the seat numbers
[2019-09-25, 11:53:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Or he'll upload receipts so trashed that I have no idea what they say
[2019-09-25, 12:14:29 PM] Rob Feeny: And somehow, anything he does on a computer turns to a disaster. I'm trying figure out how he exported all his CC statements in a way that crashes Excel every time I try to sort them
[2019-09-25, 12:15:04 PM] Jamie: Yikes
[2019-09-25, 3:10:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Btw if you're interested in watching some fucked up by highly entertaining TV, check out "The Boy's" on Amazon Prime
[2019-09-25, 3:11:02 PM] Jamie: I don’t have amazon prime
[2019-09-25, 3:11:11 PM] Jamie: But a good show?
[2019-09-25, 3:11:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm sure you could find it on The Pirate Bay
[2019-09-25, 3:11:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Quite so. It's very well done
[2019-09-25, 8:35:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Ten hours of grinding and I sort of made a dent in the bookkeeping
[2019-09-25, 8:35:26 PM] Rob Feeny: But I've put in 30+ in the last week
[2019-09-25, 8:48:17 PM] Jamie: Might be worth your while to keep notes of his common mistakes for a cheat sheet for him
[2019-09-25, 8:48:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes I'm writing an instruction manual as I go
[2019-09-26, 8:39:44 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob can I crash at your house on October 14? I get in quite late if I accept this ride like 915 but I think she’ll drop me off at your house
[2019-09-26, 8:46:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup I'll be just returning from a trip but leave a key in case
[2019-09-26, 10:18:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Can you help me with a calculation? A 1000W AC inverter, how many amps DC would it pull? My calculations say 83A which seems crazy high
[2019-09-26, 10:30:09 PM] Jamie: I can’t explain it very well but you divide that number by 10.
[2019-09-26, 10:31:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Sheeeet. Ok the inverter I have in the van would burn out the cabling if you tried to use it at 1000w then
[2019-09-26, 10:32:17 PM] Rob Feeny: And trash the battery fast. I have 180Ah of reserve, so it'd wipe it out in an hour max
[2019-09-26, 10:34:50 PM] Jamie: Sorry dude. Just smoked a joint, not much help
[2019-09-26, 10:35:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha not much changed then
[2019-09-27, 10:08:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Well the time has come to unfollow Cousin Neil on FB
[2019-09-27, 10:08:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Looks like he found God :S
[2019-09-27, 10:09:28 AM] Jamie: Yeah I read that. Haha what a wild ride that post was
[2019-09-27, 10:11:35 AM] Jamie: But it’s a weird religion they mentioned, ECG? Enlightened Christian Gathering?
[2019-09-27, 10:11:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Tragic. He's a classic target for conversion too
[2019-09-27, 12:14:21 PM] Jamie: Sorry I have probably asked 5 times but you are using Xero for accounting? Going to download and try it out
[2019-09-27, 12:17:04 PM] Rob Feeny: No, I used Zoho. It's decent and cheaper than other options
[2019-09-27, 12:18:03 PM] Rob Feeny: *Use
[2019-09-27, 12:18:23 PM] Rob Feeny: I like the online tech support via chat. I use it a lot
[2019-09-27, 12:21:24 PM] Jamie: Ok great. I gotta get on this shit. I’m letting expenses for by because I don’t want to invite more cost with my corporate accountants, lol.
[2019-09-27, 12:41:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha yah the data entry is pretty easy once you've got it sorted
‎[2019-09-28, 12:10:44 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-28, 12:11:35 PM] Jamie: Average is 1.5 - 2hrs
[2019-09-28, 12:42:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy jeez. At Mom's?
[2019-09-28, 12:42:43 PM] Jamie: Yup.
[2019-09-28, 12:43:36 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm so jealous.
[2019-09-28, 12:43:53 PM] Jamie: How is your sleep these days?
[2019-09-28, 3:54:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Decent when I get it. Been putting in long days and never getting enough rest
[2019-09-28, 3:54:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Does that app use your apple watch?
[2019-09-28, 4:07:56 PM] Jamie: Yeah. But you can just use the phone if you sleep with the phone beside you in bed
‎[2019-09-30, 3:15:38 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-09-30, 3:19:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow I hadn't seen it assembled!
[2019-09-30, 3:19:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Guys is doing incredible stuff
[2019-09-30, 3:19:54 PM] Rob Feeny: *that guy
[2019-09-30, 3:21:14 PM] Jamie: Really is. For all the haters, he has done more in his life so far than could be imagined. Usually people like this die early.  🤞
[2019-09-30, 3:29:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha it's funny he's basically paralleling the career of a sci-fi hero from when I was a kid
[2019-09-30, 3:31:34 PM] Jamie: Elon musk is?
[2019-09-30, 3:32:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. I actually read several books when I was younger that basically used the idea that the government is never going to get us into space and it's going to take someone who would rather get our race into space than be insanely wealthy
[2019-09-30, 3:40:05 PM] Jamie: What books?
[2019-09-30, 3:58:34 PM] Rob Feeny: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_Trilogy
[2019-09-30, 3:58:47 PM] Rob Feeny: That's the one I recall. Anything by Steven Baxter is mind blowijg
[2019-09-30, 3:58:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Can't recall the other one at the moment
[2019-10-01, 2:04:21 PM] Rob Feeny: When are you headed down here again?
[2019-10-02, 1:08:55 PM] Jamie: Hey I’m coming the 14th around 9:30pm
[2019-10-02, 2:00:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok put it in my calendar this Time
[2019-10-02, 9:58:54 PM] Jamie: Coolio
[2019-10-07, 7:14:26 PM] Rob Feeny: So if I want to measure the amperage flowing through a circuit I need to wire my multimeter in series with the circuit right?
[2019-10-07, 7:46:55 PM] Jamie: Yes
[2019-10-07, 8:32:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Thx
[2019-10-07, 8:36:50 PM] Jamie: Get it working?
[2019-10-08, 11:30:51 AM] Jamie: Shots going on in Ecuador right now. When you have a chance, google it
[2019-10-08, 11:31:01 AM] Jamie: Shit’s*
[2019-10-08, 11:44:34 AM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap man
[2019-10-08, 11:44:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Prob won't affect Olon but yikes
[2019-10-08, 11:45:15 AM] Jamie: Yeah it’s super calm there and taxis are working apparently
[2019-10-08, 11:45:53 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm sure the prices went up but hey do you ever need a taxi in Olon?
[2019-10-08, 11:45:57 AM] Jamie: It’s getting out of the airport to Puerto Engabao that might be the struggle. No buses right now and barely any taxis
[2019-10-08, 11:46:49 AM] Jamie: Just to get to montanita but it’s only $1.50 and the bus is $0.50 so it can go up and it’s ok
[2019-10-08, 11:47:08 AM] Jamie: But we will see in a few weeks what it looks like
[2019-10-08, 11:55:09 AM] Jamie: Uggg. Morgan wants me to cancel my PopARide and travel back with him on Monday. Pay him the $40 cash. If it was free, I would deal with the unpredictability but for the same price?
[2019-10-08, 12:02:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn tough call man
[2019-10-08, 12:02:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Tell him you can't cancel without losing half your money
[2019-10-08, 12:02:44 PM] Rob Feeny: And encourage him to post his seat
[2019-10-08, 12:03:04 PM] Jamie: He still has 5 seats posted
[2019-10-08, 12:03:25 PM] Jamie: And the trip I’m scheduled for has 3 good looking women in it 😎
[2019-10-08, 12:03:37 PM] Jamie: Haha a dilemma
[2019-10-08, 12:08:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha he'll get people
[2019-10-08, 12:08:38 PM] Rob Feeny: All the last minute folks
[2019-10-09, 8:47:49 AM] Rob Feeny: And I have 3 $5 promo codes that expire on Nov 23, but you won't be going anywhere else will you?
[2019-10-09, 8:59:38 AM] Jamie: Well, depends if I can’t fly to Ecuador I guess
[2019-10-09, 9:01:39 AM] Rob Feeny: I think you'll be fine, you don't fly through the capital and I bet you could sort a ride with the language school or something if taxis are shut down
[2019-10-09, 9:02:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Stuff like that rarely affects the tourists and is always blown out of proportion by the media
[2019-10-09, 9:02:33 AM] Jamie: I think you are right. I have some lots of people that are making it through, just takes a little more time and money
[2019-10-09, 9:07:25 AM] Rob Feeny: But still probably cheaper than changing flights and staying here!
[2019-10-10, 11:58:25 AM] Jamie: True. And I will get fat here in the winter haha
[2019-10-10, 11:59:01 AM] Jamie: Think you might have an hour to help me get setup in your accounting software? Sometime during the 2 weeks I’m there?
[2019-10-10, 11:59:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Sure no problem
[2019-10-10, 11:59:35 AM] Jamie: Thanks. What do I need? End of last fiscal year amounts?
[2019-10-10, 12:03:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Exactly. And we can link your accounts to import. But we'll just need starting balances. When does your fiscal year start?
[2019-10-10, 12:03:55 PM] Jamie: Aug 1 2019
[2019-10-10, 12:13:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok that works well
[2019-10-10, 2:25:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Can I use an AC toggle switch for 12v DC?
[2019-10-10, 2:26:41 PM] Jamie: Totally
[2019-10-10, 2:27:12 PM] Rob Feeny: That one says AC on it but the ad says DC
[2019-10-10, 2:27:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok cool
[2019-10-10, 2:27:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Thx
‎[2019-10-10, 2:27:18 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-10-10, 2:29:21 PM] Jamie: That’s seems expensive.
[2019-10-10, 2:31:05 PM] Rob Feeny: It's for 4 but it's not the one I'll buy, I just want that on/off flange
[2019-10-10, 2:31:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll find a cheaper one on there
[2019-10-11, 11:06:49 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha. I invoiced for 19.75hrs for yesterday. Yikes
[2019-10-11, 11:06:57 AM] Rob Feeny: A nice tidy $800 day
[2019-10-11, 11:07:34 AM] Jamie: Holy crap. Nice work. Who?
[2019-10-11, 11:12:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Tim Jones, AV guy. 11hrs on a site with him then 4.5hrs of double time at the Microsoft store
[2019-10-11, 11:12:34 AM] Rob Feeny: Almost killed him. Fack. He's getting old and needs to retire
[2019-10-11, 11:19:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Not going away now this weekend, see you when you get here
[2019-10-11, 11:22:01 AM] Jamie: He gets business though
[2019-10-11, 11:22:30 AM] Jamie: Cool. I’m riding back with Morgan so hopefully by 5pm not 9pm like I thought
[2019-10-11, 11:22:33 AM] Rob Feeny: He does. Rolando is lining up to take over his clientele, if he doesn't kill him befofe
[2019-10-11, 11:22:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha he convinced you
[2019-10-11, 11:22:47 AM] Rob Feeny: So much for the girls
[2019-10-11, 11:23:20 AM] Jamie: Yeah I couldn’t really say no without it being weird. And I would rather leave earlier
[2019-10-11, 11:24:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Did it cost you anything to cancel?
[2019-10-11, 11:24:32 AM] Jamie: Yeah $7.
[2019-10-11, 11:24:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Not too bad. Make him buy you coffee
[2019-10-11, 11:25:14 AM] Rob Feeny: I think he needs the money, I'm getting messages from things like Tsheets saying his payment didn't go through
[2019-10-11, 11:25:37 AM] Jamie: Well he wants payment for the trip so I pay $40 cash to him. Same cost to me
[2019-10-11, 11:26:01 AM] Jamie: I think so too
[2019-10-11, 11:27:05 AM] Jamie: Long day today too?
[2019-10-11, 11:27:46 AM] Rob Feeny: I think Fairmont is always a money pit for him and his parasites too
[2019-10-11, 11:27:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope, just at the mechanic
[2019-10-11, 11:28:01 AM] Rob Feeny: Ugh. Have a told you much about Sheila?
[2019-10-11, 11:28:21 AM] Jamie: No but I saw the pictures of you guys. Did it go sideways?
[2019-10-11, 11:28:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhhh no, Something else entirely. It's been amazing.
[2019-10-11, 11:28:59 AM] Rob Feeny: She broke up with her wife
[2019-10-11, 11:29:06 AM] Rob Feeny: And is looking at apartments
[2019-10-11, 11:29:23 AM] Jamie: In Vancouver?
[2019-10-11, 11:31:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Yes. She's still studying at UBC. But awkward position for me. I don't want to be her rebound. We've been dating for 2 months and I was at the point of saying girlfriend but it's kinda fucky now... It's like anyone who tries an open relationship's worst nightmare
[2019-10-11, 11:31:47 AM] Rob Feeny: But she assures me 1000% I wasn't the reason and she'll understand if I walk away
[2019-10-11, 11:32:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Evidently it was long-term stuff that came to a head but yikes
[2019-10-11, 11:32:30 AM] Rob Feeny: They've only been married 3 years
[2019-10-11, 11:32:38 AM] Jamie: And how old is she?
[2019-10-11, 11:32:51 AM] Rob Feeny: She's 28. Katie her wife is 26
[2019-10-11, 11:33:35 AM] Rob Feeny: Messed relationship though. Sheila is basically mom to a super depressed, mopey child. I have been trying to help her with her depression and it's like talking to an angsty teen
[2019-10-11, 11:34:35 AM] Jamie: Katie? Yikes. Will you inherit that? If you and Sheila work out, does Katie (new best friend) come with it?
[2019-10-11, 11:35:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Well, to be honest, from the start Katie has been the biggest hurdle to anything with Sheila being a legit long-term thing. We're both comfortable with Poly etc but I'm not attracted to her
[2019-10-11, 11:35:49 AM] Jamie: Pics?
‎[2019-10-11, 11:41:54 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-10-11, 11:42:08 AM] Rob Feeny: She takes pics to hide it but she's out of shape and gaining weight
[2019-10-11, 11:43:01 AM] Jamie: Haha me too. Seriously feel out of shape right now.
[2019-10-11, 11:43:11 AM] Jamie: Yeah not so much
[2019-10-11, 11:43:12 AM] Rob Feeny: The first time I met her was unpleasant. Like hanging out with some grouchy introvert who judges everything I say for being politically incorrect. She's never lived in the real world (many years of academia and government work)
[2019-10-11, 11:43:27 AM] Jamie: Oh boy
[2019-10-11, 11:43:40 AM] Jamie: I’m sure that went over well with you
[2019-10-11, 11:44:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh man. I felt like I was working to make her like me the whole time and eventually gave up
[2019-10-11, 11:45:10 AM] Rob Feeny: I think what has happened is that spending time with someone that ISN'T work has helped Sheila realize what she's been doing
[2019-10-11, 11:45:54 AM] Rob Feeny: It was scary to spend the weekend with the two of them. Sheila spent then entire weekend working to take care of her and keep her happy. She even boxed her food for her at the restaurant and had to ask the server for things for her
[2019-10-11, 11:47:11 AM] Jamie: So you sleep with Sheila but not Katie? How did that work on the weekend getaway?
[2019-10-11, 11:49:18 AM] Rob Feeny: I slept with Katie on that trip 🤣
[2019-10-11, 11:49:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Sheila's idea. Honestly looking back it seemed to be more of her mothering her. Katie wanted to get laid, Sheila provided
[2019-10-11, 11:50:04 AM] Jamie: And was she just as moody and selfish in bed?
[2019-10-11, 11:50:09 AM] Rob Feeny: But the rest of the trip was Sheila and I wanting to go hook up and Katie being everpresent
[2019-10-11, 11:50:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha she's extremely submissive in bed. So she'll doing anything you ask. But Sheila says she's tired of always being in charge, even in bed
[2019-10-11, 11:52:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Sheila is extremely sexually liberal like myself
[2019-10-11, 12:02:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Huh I think I just found the nicest jj bean in Vancouver
[2019-10-11, 12:02:52 PM] Jamie: Main st?
[2019-10-11, 12:03:10 PM] Rob Feeny: North Van, park and tilford
[2019-10-11, 12:03:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok well, in the metro area
[2019-10-11, 12:03:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I was waiting for MEC to open so I wandered over
[2019-10-11, 12:25:52 PM] Jamie: Yeah I’ve seen pictures. The one on Main st is pretty nice too. Specially in the summer.
[2019-10-11, 12:26:13 PM] Jamie: Hey I need to move my website to a different host. Is this something you have done?
[2019-10-11, 12:26:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope. But host it on my package man, it's way under utilized
[2019-10-11, 12:26:46 PM] Jamie: Do you have a minute to chat?
[2019-10-11, 12:27:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep

[2019-10-11, 12:55:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect. The brother sucks one? 🤣
[2019-10-11, 1:55:40 PM] Jamie: I think so. I used my password keeper
[2019-10-11, 1:56:33 PM] Jamie: So when I called host gator they couldn’t give me hard numbers but when I told him I wanted to store 50 videos on there, she tried to upgrade the package. But I figured out how to store on Amazon Web services for free for one year and then a few dollars a month after that
[2019-10-11, 1:56:55 PM] Jamie: I think I will move the website over to host gator within the next few days but then store all of the content elsewhere
[2019-10-11, 1:57:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Okay. It makes sense. I think they don't give you an actual limit because the more you host the more bandwidth you use and the more they can sell you
[2019-10-11, 2:08:08 PM] Jamie: Exactly.
[2019-10-12, 7:20:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Just did a 25km trail run. Ouch
[2019-10-12, 7:27:50 PM] Jamie: Ouch is right
[2019-10-12, 7:34:46 PM] Rob Feeny: I didn't think I had it in me!
[2019-10-13, 2:03:01 PM] Rob Feeny: And now I'm effing sore
[2019-10-13, 2:03:23 PM] Jamie: Haha to be expected.
[2019-10-13, 2:04:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Needed tho
[2019-10-14, 6:13:58 PM] Jamie: Just in Abbotsford but stopping at Courtney to drop off Logan
[2019-10-14, 6:32:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok ok
‎[2019-10-14, 6:32:43 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-10-14, 7:10:04 PM] Jamie: This is so you
[2019-10-14, 7:15:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha
[2019-10-14, 7:15:18 PM] Rob Feeny: The shed is so clean!
[2019-10-14, 8:08:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Just running up to get cash
[2019-10-14, 8:08:27 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2019-10-14, 8:11:12 PM] Jamie: No word from Morgan. Let’s do those steaks
[2019-10-14, 8:12:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha ok want to grab two from the kitchen freezer and put them in some warm water?
[2019-10-14, 8:12:18 PM] Rob Feeny: We could grill them on the fire
[2019-10-15, 6:14:16 PM] Jamie: You working late?
[2019-10-15, 6:15:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Headed to Fairmont after work to hot tub
[2019-10-15, 6:17:26 PM] Rob Feeny: You'd love what I'm hacking together. TV optical out to DAC, DAC thru RCA to 2 different rg6/cable lines as L/R to comms box, then from those rg6 runs to a balun to send the audio over Cat5 to another balun in the rack, then back to RCA to feed into the receiver
[2019-10-15, 6:18:06 PM] Jamie: Oh god. How do you trace that out in 5 years when something fails, lll
[2019-10-15, 6:18:10 PM] Jamie: Llll
[2019-10-15, 6:18:15 PM] Jamie: lol*
[2019-10-15, 6:18:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Lots of labels!
[2019-10-15, 6:18:36 PM] Rob Feeny: This is a retrofit job
[2019-10-15, 6:18:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Total mess
‎[2019-10-15, 6:19:10 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-10-15, 6:19:16 PM] Jamie: Sounds like you are making the best of it
[2019-10-15, 6:19:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah it's T&M and I'm learning a lot
[2019-10-15, 6:46:09 PM] Jamie: Hey where is the house key hidden back here?
[2019-10-15, 6:49:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Near my shed door, in the plastic garden box. Left corner
[2019-10-15, 6:50:15 PM] Jamie: Got it!
[2019-10-15, 11:32:36 PM] Jamie: Is it easy to get the heater on in the camper van?
[2019-10-15, 11:34:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. Look for the thermostat above the tea towel rack
[2019-10-15, 11:34:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Switch it on and bam
[2019-10-15, 11:34:31 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm pretty sure I didn't turn the propane off
[2019-10-15, 11:35:27 PM] Jamie: Ok I heard it click on. Thx. Just to take the edge off while I watch a movie
[2019-10-16, 12:15:35 AM] Jamie: Should the air from the vent be warm?

[2019-10-16, 12:20:09 AM] Jamie: Ok no worries. I’ve got your big sweater
[2019-10-16, 10:16:56 PM] Jamie: Figures. I think I left my USB transformer and watch charger there. Can you bring it on Friday?
[2019-10-16, 10:17:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure no worries
[2019-10-16, 10:21:13 PM] Jamie: Thx. Knew I forgot something...
[2019-10-17, 12:00:38 PM] Jamie: I think I I took half your cat with me lol
[2019-10-17, 12:01:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Hopefully the bitchy half?
[2019-10-17, 12:06:33 PM] Jamie: Lol nope the fuzzy half. Left you the best part
[2019-10-17, 12:06:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Oboy
[2019-10-17, 12:07:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe I'll pack her up and bring her Friday just for you
[2019-10-17, 2:08:14 PM] Jamie: Hey HostGator is asking for email for sign in but rob.feeny@gmail.com plus the old password doesn’t work. Any ideas?
[2019-10-17, 2:10:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to just hit the reset? I'll change it
[2019-10-17, 2:10:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Can't find it
[2019-10-17, 2:10:28 PM] Jamie: Ok the old portal worked
[2019-10-17, 2:10:47 PM] Jamie: I will ask when I talk to someone what the new login should be
[2019-10-17, 2:11:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok
[2019-10-17, 2:25:12 PM] Jamie: You should be getting an email from host gator
[2019-10-17, 2:25:18 PM] Jamie: To verify ownership
[2019-10-17, 2:25:33 PM] Jamie: I think you just have to respond
[2019-10-17, 2:28:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Done
[2019-10-17, 2:37:09 PM] Jamie: Thx. What a mess it is to move hosts. And this guy at HostGator is just reading off a screen
[2019-10-17, 2:54:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah crap. Thought it would be easier.
[2019-10-17, 2:54:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Should have paid some guy in India to do it
[2019-10-17, 3:04:07 PM] Jamie: Hey when I uploaded my database, it seemed to fill in a blank in what was rfeeny_wp2. Do you know what that was? He said it would not overwrite an existing one
[2019-10-17, 3:05:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I did some tinkering originally. If feeny.ca and SATW are still up You're good
[2019-10-17, 3:06:16 PM] Jamie: Ok great.
[2019-10-17, 3:06:46 PM] Jamie: Feeny.ca and both sub domains, SATW and even floaterboating is there
[2019-10-17, 3:06:58 PM] Jamie: Haha what the heck is floaterboating?
[2019-10-17, 3:07:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha it's an annual event a friend holds. I sold him the domain
[2019-10-17, 6:56:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you put that key back in the box?
[2019-10-17, 6:57:28 PM] Jamie: Shit No I left it on your table with the van keys. Does someone need it?
[2019-10-17, 6:57:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah Sheila is outside
[2019-10-17, 6:57:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'm 10min always
[2019-10-17, 6:57:55 PM] Jamie: Ah shit
[2019-10-17, 6:58:01 PM] Jamie: Tell her it’s my fault
[2019-10-17, 7:37:11 PM] Rob Feeny: I did. Haha. She says you suck.
[2019-10-17, 7:38:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey you might know this... Say an employee is paid $35 an hour, what's the actual cost to the business per hour?
[2019-10-17, 7:38:49 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm writing Tim an email after some utter bullshit today on a site and raising his prices
[2019-10-17, 7:39:11 PM] Rob Feeny: But want to know how much he saves because I'm a contractor
[2019-10-17, 7:40:25 PM] Jamie: When I had to estimate how much I have in my bank account for a payroll run I would take the number of hours and employee worked 23×1.15 and that was usually pretty close, including WCB
[2019-10-17, 7:40:48 PM] Jamie: hrs x wage*
[2019-10-17, 7:41:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok but what about costs like benefits and vehicles?
[2019-10-17, 7:41:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Tim doesn't provide gas or a vehicle
[2019-10-17, 7:41:37 PM] Jamie: Would he for an employee?
[2019-10-17, 7:41:55 PM] Jamie: I would use CRAs numbers for a taxable benefit
[2019-10-17, 7:42:10 PM] Rob Feeny: He used to when he had employees. For example today I loaded my car with tools, supplies and a ladder and went to a site
[2019-10-17, 7:42:50 PM] Jamie: did you bill him hourly for loading and transporting?
[2019-10-17, 7:43:22 PM] Rob Feeny: No. I guess I should hey? I billed him hourly for the trip to his place to get supplies last night
[2019-10-17, 7:44:06 PM] Jamie: My employees billed me if they had to go to storage and grab stuff for a job
[2019-10-17, 7:45:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'll keep googling. Thanks
[2019-10-18, 12:14:57 PM] Jamie: Hey I’m going to call HostGator again, if they ask to send you an confirmation email will you be around?
[2019-10-18, 12:16:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep just warn me because I have no notifications on my emails
[2019-10-18, 12:16:07 PM] Jamie: Do you know the security pin?
[2019-10-18, 12:16:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Try 2486 if not that, no
[2019-10-18, 12:31:08 PM] Jamie: Could you forward the email they are sending?
[2019-10-18, 12:31:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Done
[2019-10-18, 12:39:06 PM] Jamie: Cool thanks. Ok so now I just wait to see what the moved site looks like.
[2019-10-18, 12:41:34 PM] Jamie: Appreciate your help
[2019-10-18, 12:45:15 PM] Rob Feeny: 👍🏾
[2019-10-18, 8:26:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Finally got home from work, leaving in 10
[2019-10-18, 8:27:26 PM] Jamie: No worries. Just cleaning up after the kitchen reno. Should be perfect timing, lol
[2019-10-19, 2:34:36 PM] Jamie: So in BC the corporate naming convention is 3 parts. The distinctive name (Smith), the descriptive name (Electrical) and the Corp identifier (Ltd, Corp, Inc. Etc)
[2019-10-19, 2:34:56 PM] Jamie: So I don’t think I can get Feeny Corp ir Feeny Inc.
[2019-10-19, 2:35:29 PM] Jamie: I can get Jamie Feeny Inc. Or something like Feeny Services Inc (which might be too vague)
[2019-10-19, 2:36:00 PM] Jamie: Can you think of any other good names using this naming method?
[2019-10-19, 2:36:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Can't you use a generic term like "FeenyCorp Enterprises Ltd"
[2019-10-19, 2:36:41 PM] Jamie: Feeny Enterprises Ltd might be good
[2019-10-19, 2:37:31 PM] Rob Feeny: And really for legal stuff you can use the full name but CocaCola doesn't say "Coca-Cola bottle Inc" for all branding etc
[2019-10-19, 2:37:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Or go with a numbered and a trade name
[2019-10-19, 2:38:20 PM] Jamie: 829920628 BC Inc
[2019-10-19, 2:38:55 PM] Jamie: And I think you can have multiple DBAs for one corporation. I’m trying to figure out if my web address is distinctive enough for a doing business as name
[2019-10-19, 2:40:31 PM] Rob Feeny: iPhone and a drone?
[2019-10-19, 2:40:38 PM] Jamie: Yes
[2019-10-19, 2:41:02 PM] Jamie: Or even www.iphoneandadrone.com
[2019-10-20, 1:02:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Oops the gas was off in the van.
[2019-10-20, 1:05:28 PM] Jamie: Haha I figured
[2019-10-20, 1:05:37 PM] Jamie: I couldn’t get the stove to light
[2019-10-20, 1:05:43 PM] Rob Feeny: It's toasty now
[2019-10-20, 1:05:58 PM] Jamie: You sleeping in it?
[2019-10-20, 1:06:20 PM] Rob Feeny: No was helping out a guy who has a similar van and wanted to see how the bed works
[2019-10-20, 1:06:32 PM] Rob Feeny: So I tested it out. Sheila and I are using it this coming weekend
[2019-10-20, 1:06:37 PM] Jamie: Lol that sounds like a pickup line
[2019-10-20, 1:06:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha he's in Quebec and found me on Instagram
[2019-10-20, 4:18:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Tim, the experience of taking care of the Main Street Honey install has led to some introspection and hard looks at the work I do with you. I truly felt I had no support in that job and repeated requests that you come to site went ignored.
My pricing is $45/hr and starting Nov 1 I'll be eliminating the discount I've been giving you. If I'm solo on a site, like I was at the Honey Shoppe, using my own tools and hauling materials in my vehicle, there is a $5/hr premium on top of my regular pricing.
This is fair pricing and much cheaper than an employee. It's also $5/hr less than I offer others like Rob from WestCoast AV Galleries and the same pricing I give Morgan who's been a friend for 20 years. The $40 was a mistake. When Rolando asked me for a price, I thought he meant to help him the next day, not for long term subcontracting with someone else entirely. I've been fine with it for now as I have been learning a lot from you.
[2019-10-20, 4:19:14 PM] Rob Feeny: then I go on to put "Here's bit about the value you get from a contractor" and then the calculations
[2019-10-20, 4:19:37 PM] Jamie: Yeah that’s good. It is still unclear that you’re 50 an hour if you’re alone
[2019-10-20, 4:20:02 PM] Rob Feeny: "$5 premium on top of my regular pricing" isn't clear?
[2019-10-20, 4:20:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I was trying to avoid saying $50 haha
[2019-10-20, 4:20:21 PM] Jamie: No. Your regular pricing to him was $40
[2019-10-20, 4:20:30 PM] Jamie: Yeah just get it out there
[2019-10-20, 4:20:36 PM] Rob Feeny: ok
[2019-10-20, 4:21:05 PM] Jamie: But it’s short and clear now
[2019-10-20, 4:22:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Rolando cut him back to 2 days a week and I'm his only guy at the moment so we'll see what he does.
[2019-10-20, 4:23:12 PM] Rob Feeny: If he balks, no big deal it'll force me to find someone better to work for
[2019-10-20, 4:23:31 PM] Jamie: Your prices are still reasonable at $50
[2019-10-20, 4:24:09 PM] Rob Feeny: I think he's been out of touch with the industry for too long and doesn't get that. He won't raise his rates but constantly bitches about having too much work
[2019-10-20, 8:02:03 PM] Jamie: Hey man sorry I didn’t stick around. Long day and wanted to catch a ride
[2019-10-20, 8:02:18 PM] Rob Feeny: No stress man
[2019-10-20, 8:02:26 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm still working so it's not a worry
[2019-10-21, 1:51:18 PM] Jamie: This website developer is a total asshole. The files he sent are stripped of all my plugins, media etc. I can recreate it all but basically from scratch. What a piece of shit!!
[2019-10-21, 1:57:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man. What did he say when you asked about it?
[2019-10-21, 2:01:14 PM] Jamie: He is not responding.
[2019-10-21, 2:01:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Fack. He was a Reddit guy,
[2019-10-21, 2:01:28 PM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2019-10-21, 2:01:49 PM] Jamie: I’m really disappointed that he got $10.99 USD from me for basically nothi BF
[2019-10-21, 2:01:55 PM] Jamie: nothing*
[2019-10-21, 2:01:56 PM] Jamie: Yes
[2019-10-21, 2:02:35 PM] Rob Feeny: I always wonder if those posts are all basically scams, dependent on you staying with them for some expensive hosting
[2019-10-21, 2:06:22 PM] Jamie: That was the plan and the hosting would not have been too expensive but he just sucked. In the end he said I was lucky to get any services from a real developer for just $10.99, lol.
[2019-10-21, 2:06:28 PM] Jamie: I didn’t even bother to tell him that it was his offer
[2019-10-21, 2:06:46 PM] Jamie: It’s OK. I am very quickly re-creating everything on the site
[2019-10-21, 2:07:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Good to hear. Now you'll have to keep it all in your hands
[2019-10-21, 2:18:32 PM] Jamie: Totally. Just changed all passwords etc removed him from Dropbox
‎[2019-10-22, 7:49:02 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-10-22, 7:49:08 PM] Rob Feeny: And then crickets... 🤣
[2019-10-22, 7:49:11 PM] Rob Feeny: So mature
[2019-10-22, 8:11:47 PM] Jamie: That’s annoying. Give him time. If he can’t handle that request, you are better off
[2019-10-22, 8:20:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah J think it's going to be the latter. Shame. He's a nice guy and I learned a lot from him but I really do think he's losing it.
[2019-10-22, 8:41:05 PM] Jamie: Lame.
[2019-10-22, 8:41:50 PM] Rob Feeny: C'est la vie. It's actually a bit sad. He needs to retire ASAP. Rolando was going to take over his clientele but after working with him a lot, he declined and grabbed someone else's book
[2019-10-23, 12:04:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Well the nice part is that unexpected days off are letting me get some tasks done that have been on the back burner for way, way too long
[2019-10-23, 12:04:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to run Burnaby Mountain tomorrow with Brent?
[2019-10-23, 12:29:29 PM] Jamie: Oh god. That might kill me
[2019-10-23, 12:30:08 PM] Jamie: Fair enough. I feel like he will come back. You might have just hurt his feelings in some weird way
[2019-10-23, 12:32:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Old man. It's a shortened winter route
[2019-10-23, 12:33:21 PM] Jamie: What time is it these days?
[2019-10-23, 12:33:28 PM] Jamie: I should
[2019-10-23, 12:33:52 PM] Rob Feeny: All good it's pushing me to get different work. And reminding me that I'm more than a laborer
[2019-10-23, 12:34:27 PM] Rob Feeny: It's 6pm, 11k route
[2019-10-23, 2:36:13 PM] Jamie: Can I crash at your place? Otherwise the commute is brutal
[2019-10-23, 2:39:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure, just be forewarned, Sheila is staying too. And the van might not be back from the shop yet
[2019-10-23, 2:41:19 PM] Jamie: That’s fine
[2019-10-23, 2:41:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok then for sure
[2019-10-24, 12:21:54 PM] Jamie: I don’t think I’m gonna run tonight. I’m embracing my new form, which is round
[2019-10-24, 12:22:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, fatty
[2019-10-24, 12:23:49 PM] Jamie: Haha isn’t fluffy your preferred term?
[2019-10-24, 12:24:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh some girls are fluffy. You're just fat.
[2019-10-24, 12:24:23 PM] Rob Feeny: 🤣
[2019-10-24, 12:25:15 PM] Jamie: I figure it will help my surfing. More buoyancy, less work.
[2019-10-24, 12:26:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Corey. And a round belly is probably more streamlined than those bumpy abs
[2019-10-24, 12:50:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Oops. Clearly
[2019-10-27, 11:49:02 PM] Jamie: Hey man I leave on Friday but would like to see you before I go. What’s your week like?
[2019-10-27, 11:50:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I leave Wednesday daytime for Seattle actually and I'm not back until Sunday!
[2019-10-27, 11:52:16 PM] Jamie: Ok well let’s see what happens in the next couple days but if not, we had some good backyard fire pit time 👍
[2019-10-27, 11:53:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha totally. Tomorrow night is a write-off, gotta unpack the van and get some shit done. Tues eve is fairly free
[2019-10-28, 12:01:20 AM] Jamie: Sure. Wanna come out towards main st for a beer Tuesday night?
[2019-10-28, 12:02:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah I can probably make that work, I can do a beer then pick up Sheila (she's at an event Tuesday night then coming to my place)
[2019-10-28, 12:02:57 AM] Jamie: Oh shoot I forgot I’m hanging with Zoe that evening. Let me talk to her and see if I can see her tomorrow instead and get back to you
[2019-10-28, 12:03:09 AM] Jamie: What time is her event ending?
[2019-10-28, 12:03:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok no worries
[2019-10-28, 12:03:21 AM] Rob Feeny: And I'm not sure, like 9?
[2019-10-28, 12:03:34 AM] Jamie: Ok
[2019-10-28, 10:50:43 PM] Jamie: Ok hanging with Zoe tonight, good for beers tomorrow?
[2019-10-28, 10:55:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep I can make it happen
[2019-10-28, 10:56:07 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2019-10-28, 10:57:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Just sorting stuff with her. She doesn't need to go downtown it seems
[2019-10-28, 10:57:45 PM] Jamie: Welcome to bring her if courAe
[2019-10-28, 10:57:51 PM] Jamie: of course*
[2019-10-28, 10:58:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm didn't think of that. You wouldn't mind?
[2019-10-28, 10:58:32 PM] Jamie: Nah all good
[2019-10-28, 11:03:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Anywhere good near you for a beer?
[2019-10-28, 11:03:35 PM] Rob Feeny: I think she's going to do homework

[2019-10-29, 1:35:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes it is the same. But I already have a spare and the problem is  that apple won't let me upgrade my os anymore
[2019-10-29, 1:35:48 PM] Rob Feeny: And so I can't use some programs. I need a newer one. But thanks for thinking of me
[2019-10-29, 2:29:45 PM] Jamie: El Camino's

[2019-10-29, 2:30:10 PM] Jamie: Wanna try this place? Otherwise Portland Craft is good too
[2019-10-29, 2:36:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, I've been there, cool little spot. Never been to Portland Craft tho
[2019-10-29, 2:43:28 PM] Jamie: Ok let’s go there. What time works for you?
[2019-10-29, 2:58:48 PM] Rob Feeny: 7? I won't have eaten
[2019-10-29, 2:59:29 PM] Jamie: Sure. Not sure if Portland craft has good food but maybe you can grab me and we will go find a place?
[2019-10-29, 3:02:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure that works. I'm just going to come right from work
[2019-10-29, 3:02:38 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2019-10-29, 8:11:37 PM] Rob Feeny: What your address?
[2019-10-29, 8:12:47 PM] Jamie: 4820 Inverness St, Vancouver BC
[2019-10-29, 8:13:20 PM] Rob Feeny: There about 640
[2019-10-29, 8:13:44 PM] Jamie: Sounds good
[2019-10-29, 8:40:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Here
[2019-10-29, 8:40:57 PM] Jamie: K
[2019-10-30, 2:34:11 PM] Rob Feeny: You mucking with your Gmail password?
[2019-10-30, 2:34:41 PM] Jamie: Yup. I added you as a backup email for it
[2019-10-30, 2:35:03 PM] Jamie: Getting rid of jamie@feenypower.ca
[2019-10-30, 2:35:10 PM] Jamie: Costing me $6 a month
[2019-10-30, 2:35:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh the time has come
[2019-10-30, 11:28:03 PM] Jamie: I can’t stand it when people cheap out on the remainder of the bill after I tipped well!  Kat just absorbed $5 of my tip to pay her bill 🤬
[2019-10-30, 11:30:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Tip eater!
[2019-10-30, 11:31:01 PM] Jamie: Lol
[2019-11-13, 11:28:50 AM] Jamie: Can’t get into my hostel. Outer doors are locked and no response to any of the numbers
[2019-11-13, 11:29:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh man. Where's that?
[2019-11-13, 11:29:06 AM] Jamie: Olón
[2019-11-13, 11:29:11 AM] Rob Feeny: The one you've been staying in or a new one?
[2019-11-13, 11:29:28 AM] Jamie: I’ve stayed here about 3 times
[2019-11-13, 11:29:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Looks like you're relaxing with a coffee for a bit!
[2019-11-13, 11:30:35 AM] Jamie: I’ve been sitting outside for 2 hrs already and my phone battery is dying. I’m patient but this is retarded even for ecuador
[2019-11-13, 11:32:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Not cool.
[2019-11-13, 11:32:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Maybe they're taking a siesta.. or someone quit.
[2019-11-13, 12:01:46 PM] Jamie: He was doing some work on his other house and the cleaning lady was picking up her kids
[2019-11-13, 12:01:55 PM] Jamie: Old ecuadorian guy
[2019-11-13, 12:02:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Welcome to Latin America... Where I've spent 3 hrs waiting for someone to bring me keys, the whole time they were "on their way"
[2019-11-13, 12:04:17 PM] Jamie: It’s very rare that I don’t leave the hostal with $15 in my pocket. Today I only brought coffee money to walk down to the cafe. If I had money, I could have at least eaten and gone for coffee. I won’t make that mistake again. All good
[2019-11-13, 3:29:08 PM] Rob Feeny: You finding your own place again soon?
[2019-11-13, 5:33:35 PM] Jamie: Working on it. I go Saturday to the Montanita Spanish School cabañas for a couple weeks. Gets me involved with them and people to surf with
[2019-11-13, 5:33:49 PM] Jamie: Then Dec 1 I will move to a place.
[2019-11-13, 5:35:03 PM] Jamie: I found a great little one, third floor with a view of the ocean but the kitchen is mostly open to the air with two bedrooms. One has AC but there is not hot water which is weird.
[2019-11-13, 5:50:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha AC is an easy after the fact upgrade. Does your shower head have heat?
[2019-11-13, 5:51:45 PM] Jamie: Not in the place I looked at. But the suite below it has hot water but no AC. Lol what the?
[2019-11-13, 5:52:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe it's sheltered from the sun by the suite above?
[2019-11-13, 5:53:06 PM] Jamie: Too logical for this place, ha. How things there?
[2019-11-13, 5:56:13 PM] Rob Feeny: They're decent. Semi productive day today, just getting back into it. Had a good time in Kelowna on the weekend
[2019-11-13, 5:56:26 PM] Jamie: Ahh nice. Did Sheila go?
[2019-11-13, 5:56:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup, met the P's and Tana & Jeff
[2019-11-13, 5:58:36 PM] Jamie: Cool
[2019-11-13, 6:01:43 PM] Rob Feeny: You back in the groove there?
[2019-11-13, 6:02:35 PM] Jamie: Nah not yet. I shredded the skin of my stomach the first day surfing too long in a cheap Lycra too
[2019-11-13, 6:02:40 PM] Jamie: top*
[2019-11-13, 6:02:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man. No good man
‎[2019-11-13, 6:02:58 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-11-13, 6:03:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy man. Looks painful
[2019-11-13, 6:03:45 PM] Jamie: I surfed for 2 note days but it was just getting worse. So I had to stop. It’s almost healed but it’s been 7 days of no surfing
[2019-11-13, 6:03:51 PM] Jamie: more*
[2019-11-13, 6:04:28 PM] Jamie: Haha and I was sick for 3 days from a head cold which almost always happens after all the travel. Today is the first day I am better
[2019-11-13, 6:04:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Gross
[2019-11-13, 6:04:56 PM] Jamie: But spent the days optimizing my website for shitty internet
[2019-11-13, 6:05:46 PM] Jamie: Tomorrow or Friday I will surf, Saturday I go on a surf trip then move to the cabañas. Should be good then. Already sae some smoking hot ladies from Switzerland at the school today
[2019-11-13, 6:07:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha what a hard life you have...
[2019-11-15, 5:42:52 PM] Jamie: Haha help me what does this mean?
[2019-11-15, 5:42:55 PM] Jamie: puede ser ahora alas 6  q dice
[2019-11-15, 5:43:24 PM] Jamie: It’s about an apartment
[2019-11-15, 5:43:26 PM] Rob Feeny: It could be now, at 6 o'clock, what do you say?
[2019-11-15, 5:43:36 PM] Rob Feeny: That's a guestimate, their typing blows
[2019-11-15, 5:44:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I think they are saying "que dice?" As in "what do you say?"
[2019-11-15, 5:44:36 PM] Jamie: Ahh ok makes sense. Lots of the older locals cant spell
[2019-11-15, 5:44:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Or it could be "could be at 6, no, he/she says"
[2019-11-15, 5:45:32 PM] Jamie: I jus sent back I will be there at 6
[2019-11-15, 5:45:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect
[2019-11-15, 5:45:39 PM] Jamie: Thanks. Lol.
[2019-11-15, 5:45:47 PM] Rob Feeny: And they'll be there at some point 🤣
[2019-11-19, 2:57:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey, I hope you're having an awesome day man. Anything special for your birthday?
[2019-11-19, 3:42:46 PM] Jamie: Thanks man. Not really just gonna surf then double down on dessert haha
[2019-11-19, 3:52:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Baha fatty
[2019-11-19, 3:52:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Enjoy it man. Happy birthday
[2019-11-19, 3:55:05 PM] Jamie: Cheers 🍻
[2019-11-21, 6:36:16 PM] Rob Feeny: So did your birthday go well?
[2019-11-21, 7:40:20 PM] Jamie: Yeah it did. Went to bed early cuz my stomach was a little dodgy but all good now
[2019-11-21, 7:43:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice man. I could think of worse places to spend it
[2019-11-22, 1:22:58 AM] Rob Feeny: Well if all my scheduled work happens, this week I'll have made $2100 in billed hours plus $900 in trade credits with a mechanic that I'll use on the van...
[2019-11-22, 1:23:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Not too shabby for a grunt
[2019-11-22, 1:01:53 PM] Jamie: That’s sweet Rob. For you?
[2019-11-22, 1:01:59 PM] Jamie: For who?
[2019-11-22, 1:07:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Some with Tim Jones, some with Westcoast AV, some with a buddy of Rolando's
[2019-12-03, 10:43:08 AM] Rob Feeny: How's the south?
[2019-12-03, 10:43:48 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm struggling on what to do over here. I want to come down and explore Ecuador but just got a chance to go teach Tiny House courses in New Zealand for 3 weeks at the same time
[2019-12-03, 10:55:08 AM] Jamie: Hey man
[2019-12-03, 10:55:29 AM] Jamie: It’s good. A little bit of a pain because I thought I had an apartment but he rented it out from under Neath me and I only had three or four days to find a new one
[2019-12-03, 10:55:38 AM] Jamie: But I have one now, hopefully it works out
[2019-12-03, 10:55:56 AM] Jamie: What’s the visa situation in New Zealand?
[2019-12-03, 10:56:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Ah fuck that sucks. The guy got offered more money?
[2019-12-03, 10:56:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Tourist Visa, should be super simple
[2019-12-03, 10:58:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Visa is $40, good for 3 months
[2019-12-03, 10:58:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Surfing lots?
[2019-12-03, 10:59:44 AM] Jamie: Yeah but I can’t figure it out. He rented for more money for December, maybe January but I would have been 5 months.
[2019-12-03, 11:00:04 AM] Jamie: Yup. Today wasn’t good but a couple days ago was great
[2019-12-03, 11:00:34 AM] Rob Feeny: You're looking at it from a Canadian perspective ;) They don't think of the future as much as us
[2019-12-03, 11:00:37 AM] Jamie: Eager to move to an apartment though, it’s hectic to stay in a busy hostel. Full of great people but not exactly relaxing
[2019-12-03, 11:00:47 AM] Rob Feeny: I bet. And harder to sleep
[2019-12-03, 11:01:09 AM] Jamie: Exactly. It’s possible logic was not a factor, haha
[2019-12-03, 11:01:41 AM] Jamie: Maybe. My apartment is 2 floors above a brand new kareoke bar 😬
[2019-12-03, 11:02:16 AM] Jamie: It was hard to find a good place, short notice as we come into high season. Lots of places only booked for December that aren’t available for me
[2019-12-03, 11:02:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Well at least in January you'll prob be able to upgrade
[2019-12-03, 11:03:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Or that cash now was worth more to him than cash in the future.. it's the whole used tire thing again. $10 now for a tire that lasts 3 months is better than $20 now for a tire that lasts a year, because they need the extra $10 now...
[2019-12-03, 11:04:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Or an earthquake might destroy the building in January haha
[2019-12-03, 11:04:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Ugh I wish I had more money for traveling
[2019-12-03, 11:04:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Just bought a new (to me) laptop yesterday and it stung
[2019-12-03, 11:22:33 AM] Jamie: I bet. Why did you get?
[2019-12-03, 11:24:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Late 2013 MBP, 13" with Retina screen. 16gb of RAM, 512gb SSD
[2019-12-03, 11:24:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Significant upgrade
[2019-12-03, 12:26:45 PM] Jamie: Same as mine but 1 year older. Good specs
[2019-12-03, 1:06:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Thx, took a while to find. $560 cash for it
[2019-12-04, 8:55:47 AM] Jamie: Not bad at all. When I upgrade, I think all my accessories will work for you
‎[2019-12-05, 6:51:42 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-12-05, 6:52:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Sweet, chicken, rice and diarrhea
[2019-12-05, 6:52:30 PM] Rob Feeny: 🤣
[2019-12-05, 6:52:35 PM] Jamie: Best diet ever!
[2019-12-05, 6:53:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Is that a paper plate on the right?
[2019-12-05, 6:53:03 PM] Jamie: And that red stuff is just white onions and hot sauce mixed.
[2019-12-05, 6:53:39 PM] Jamie: Nope. Classy place, all picnic table chairs and half barrel bbqs
[2019-12-05, 6:53:59 PM] Jamie: On a street corner. Lol
[2019-12-05, 6:54:08 PM] Jamie: Figure out where you are going?
[2019-12-05, 6:56:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Wowzas
[2019-12-05, 6:56:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Not yet. Money is part of it and that has me stressed at the moment
[2019-12-05, 6:56:53 PM] Jamie: Fair enough.
[2019-12-05, 7:00:15 PM] Rob Feeny: NZ would be amazing as it's a new place and I like teaching but it's expensive there and the flight is 1500
[2019-12-05, 7:02:29 PM] Jamie: Might be an investment into your reputation in the tiny house world.
[2019-12-05, 7:11:09 PM] Rob Feeny: It might. And I'd learn stuff for sure
[2019-12-05, 7:12:01 PM] Jamie: It’s not gonna hurt my feelings if your go that way dude. Love to have ya here of course
[2019-12-05, 7:18:33 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll waffle for at least a month before I decide 🤣

[2019-12-08, 3:00:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Sweet! Kinda badass
[2019-12-08, 3:00:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Do they have Nissan Patrols down there?

‎[2019-12-08, 3:03:04 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-12-08, 3:03:57 PM] Jamie: That is a Nissan patroñ
[2019-12-08, 3:04:02 PM] Jamie: Patrol*
[2019-12-08, 3:04:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh shit didn't look that closely
[2019-12-08, 3:04:31 PM] Rob Feeny: It seems different than the ones I saw in ESA
[2019-12-08, 3:04:32 PM] Jamie: A 2 door, convertible
[2019-12-08, 3:04:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe the generation before?
[2019-12-08, 3:09:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I'd love to turn on the the long wheelbase ones into a convertible
[2019-12-08, 3:09:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Room for all the friends and beers
[2019-12-10, 8:51:58 AM] Jamie: Hey you don’t use shampoo anymore do you? My scalp acne is really bad and seems to be worse when I use shampoo from here. I’ve stopped cold turkey but my head is getting pretty dry now. Any advice?
[2019-12-10, 10:09:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Just wait.. after you stop using it for a while your scalp skin normalizes. I use conditioner every once in a while
[2019-12-10, 10:09:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Or coconut oil?
[2019-12-10, 10:18:35 AM] Rob Feeny: Did you ever try to find a sulfur soap down there?
[2019-12-10, 2:36:09 PM] Jamie: Not yet. But I’ve read about it
[2019-12-10, 2:38:44 PM] Rob Feeny: I've found it at Walmart, a pharmacy and also an an artisan soap stall at the local market. It's very effective with acne.
[2019-12-10, 2:38:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Graz used to use it on her skin irritation
[2019-12-10, 2:39:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Azufre is sulfur
[2019-12-10, 2:39:10 PM] Jamie: Ok I will check the supermaxxi
[2019-12-10, 2:39:42 PM] Jamie: Nice. So hard to nail down the cause of these things as I get older.
[2019-12-10, 2:40:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Totally. It's interesting because with the same genetics I haven't had the same issues, so I guess it's environmental or diet?
[2019-12-10, 2:41:21 PM] Rob Feeny: It makes me think about how you reacted to a chest waxing when I don't
[2019-12-10, 2:41:38 PM] Jamie: It could be that I’m switching back-and-forth from Ecuador to Vancouver to Kelona but I had to scale back to you as far back is going to El Salvador
[2019-12-10, 2:44:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes I remember that. But why do you react and I don't? And I've never even heard of someone else reacting to the environment change like that
[2019-12-10, 2:44:32 PM] Rob Feeny: You tried that blue azulene oil I use right?
[2019-12-11, 12:42:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm sad to say that I seem to have lost my Feeny Power hoodie 😭
[2019-12-11, 12:42:31 PM] Jamie: To Sheila?
[2019-12-11, 12:43:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope, on a site somewhere or something
[2019-12-11, 12:44:04 PM] Jamie: It had a pretty good run. I’m sad I didn’t keep one for myself. Guess I could have one or two more made
[2019-12-11, 12:45:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah it was covered in a lot of spray foam and PL and paint...
[2019-12-11, 2:21:01 PM] Rob Feeny: You around?
[2019-12-11, 6:46:33 PM] Jamie: Sorry was a few towns over surfing, what’s up?
[2019-12-11, 7:01:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Had an electrical trouble shooting question but got a handle on it
[2019-12-12, 5:34:30 PM] Jamie: So I have some issues with ants. I put all my food scrap in a bag in the freezer until garbage day but they seem to like the liquid from fruits that goes down the drain when I was the dishes. Also they like eating the gecko poop. The dish soap works well if I leave a coating on the counters, they avoid it but sometime there are about 20-30 in the middle of the floor and I can’t figure out why
[2019-12-12, 5:35:04 PM] Jamie: Also no food is in the cupboards just in Tupperware containers on top of the fridge with no issue
[2019-12-12, 5:36:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Kill the fuckers. Find some borax (ask at a laundry place or I paid like $2 in the super). Mix it with honey. A drop or two in the corners of the room brings them in like a frenzy and they take it back to the next
[2019-12-12, 5:36:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Nest
[2019-12-12, 5:36:53 PM] Rob Feeny: If I replaced the drops once a week it meant I was basically ant free
[2019-12-12, 5:37:18 PM] Jamie: Ok sounds like a plan
[2019-12-12, 5:37:59 PM] Rob Feeny: It was also normal to leave the oil (if you use any) sitting in a small dish of water
[2019-12-12, 5:38:09 PM] Jamie: Haha still got some ant PTSD?
[2019-12-12, 5:38:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Also normal in ESA to have ants in the sugar and just pick them out 🤣
[2019-12-12, 5:38:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Fucking hate those bastards
[2019-12-12, 5:38:26 PM] Jamie: Is the oil a trap?
[2019-12-12, 5:38:34 PM] Rob Feeny: No, no, like cooking oit
[2019-12-12, 5:38:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Oil
[2019-12-12, 5:38:42 PM] Rob Feeny: They love anything oily
[2019-12-12, 5:38:51 PM] Jamie: Right. But you put it out and they go in it and get trapped
[2019-12-12, 5:38:57 PM] Jamie: I have oil.
[2019-12-12, 5:39:07 PM] Jamie: I will do that right now
[2019-12-12, 5:39:18 PM] Jamie: Did you hear about Cassidy?
[2019-12-12, 5:39:40 PM] Rob Feeny: No? Did she get married or something?
[2019-12-12, 5:40:25 PM] Jamie: She was in a bad car accident a few days ago. Life threatening injuries. On her way to work at 4:30am
[2019-12-12, 5:40:54 PM] Jamie: https://www.google.ca/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/local/british-columbia/2019/12/10/1_4723504.html
[2019-12-12, 5:40:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap. Not cool, I'm sorry to hear it
[2019-12-12, 5:41:33 PM] Jamie: Yeah poor girl has some bad luck in life
[2019-12-12, 5:41:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy shit
[2019-12-12, 5:41:58 PM] Rob Feeny: That car is crushed. Damn I hope she recovers well
[2019-12-12, 5:42:05 PM] Jamie: Yeah that drivers side is crushed
‎[2019-12-12, 7:08:30 PM] Jamie: ‎video omitted
[2019-12-12, 7:10:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha and an empty dance floor
[2019-12-12, 7:10:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Because who needs hearing?
[2019-12-12, 7:11:30 PM] Jamie: This is day 3 of 4. They “test” the system until about 10 before the bands come. And then the people. Until 4:30 in the morning.
[2019-12-12, 7:12:31 PM] Jamie: Luckily I can barely hear it from my place. Haha when I go for coffee in the morning 45 year old fat locals are staggering around.
[2019-12-12, 7:17:17 PM] Rob Feeny: What a life
[2019-12-12, 7:17:44 PM] Jamie: They seem to enjoy it.
[2019-12-12, 7:23:09 PM] Rob Feeny: What's the occasion?
[2019-12-12, 7:23:19 PM] Jamie: I have no idea
[2019-12-12, 7:24:00 PM] Jamie: Something something comuna something something politician something something Olón.
[2019-12-12, 7:25:42 PM] Jamie: It’s not that I didn’t try to figure it out. There doesn’t seem to be a reason other than the guy that reps Olón in the provincial government brought in some bands and DJs. But everyone knew it would be for 4 days so it hi k it happens each year around this time.
[2019-12-12, 7:25:56 PM] Jamie: 🤷‍♂️
[2019-12-12, 7:30:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha just roll with it
[2019-12-12, 7:35:09 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm trying a new ADHD med. It's actually quite effective
[2019-12-12, 7:35:11 PM] Rob Feeny: But gives me drymouth
[2019-12-12, 7:36:04 PM] Jamie: Happy to hear it helps Rob
[2019-12-12, 7:42:24 PM] Jamie: How is it helping?
[2019-12-12, 7:42:24 PM] Rob Feeny: We'll see how it goes in the long-term
[2019-12-12, 7:43:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm it's hard to explain, but I just find myself more able to slip into the focus that lets you ignore all the stimulus around you
[2019-12-12, 7:43:19 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm basically doing legal meth, but at least it's helping
[2019-12-12, 7:43:32 PM] Jamie: Expensive?
[2019-12-12, 7:45:21 PM] Rob Feeny: $4 a day
[2019-12-12, 7:45:31 PM] Rob Feeny: So yes, but if it helps, worth it
[2019-12-12, 7:46:08 PM] Jamie: 4 hrs of work a month.
[2019-12-12, 7:48:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Exactly
[2019-12-12, 7:49:43 PM] Rob Feeny: The pharmacist also said there are plenty of freebie cards floating about and to ask the doc. Most people have coverage so they build up. She said some people have come in with 20 months of free cards
[2019-12-12, 7:54:32 PM] Rob Feeny: How goes your mental work? Starting to get an idea of what you want to do in the next few years?
[2019-12-12, 7:55:54 PM] Jamie: I’m generally ok. Lonely sometimes. The surfing helps, each day that I surf the endorphins and the way my body feels after the exercise helps my mental state.
[2019-12-12, 7:57:18 PM] Jamie: The scalp acne is a tough one because I can’t seem to solve it. The no shampoo is helping but not totally. It’s hard to go out when I know I have maybe 20 red spots or 3 or 4 white heads on my scalp
[2019-12-12, 7:57:44 PM] Jamie: It’s a small thing but it gets to me
[2019-12-12, 7:58:58 PM] Jamie: As for the future? Not sure yet. I’m slowly picking up some work back in Canada with some old clients (mostly though morgan) so at least I have made some cash.
[2019-12-12, 7:59:26 PM] Jamie: The drone videos haven’t made much yet but that will come. And it earns me lots of free beer
[2019-12-12, 8:07:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yeah and it gets you out with people, lets you feel a bit special I'm sure (Jamie's the drone guy...)
[2019-12-12, 8:08:12 PM] Rob Feeny: It's satisfying to be able to show people the footage I'm sure
[2019-12-12, 8:08:38 PM] Rob Feeny: I get it for sure. Wish I could help!
[2019-12-12, 8:11:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I'm desperate to get out myself, construction is not good for the soul, unless you're doing it for yourself. Hence the van project and side stuff. Not happy to be dependent on labour work for my living but still not ready to commit to a 9-5
[2019-12-12, 8:12:22 PM] Jamie: Really is. If someone wants to learn to be a better surfer, the videos are super interesting to them.
[2019-12-12, 8:51:50 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet. I was thinking the other day how I want video of me doing yoga to help me improve my form
[2019-12-12, 8:52:22 PM] Rob Feeny: You could pair up with higher level surf instructors...
[2019-12-16, 9:57:54 AM] Rob Feeny: You doing some login/password stuff down there?
[2019-12-16, 9:58:46 AM] Jamie: Yeah I’m having trouble with sending emails through feeny.jamie@gmail.com. Just gets stuck in the outbox.
[2019-12-16, 9:59:02 AM] Jamie: Deleted and re added, but same problem.
[2019-12-16, 9:59:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm strange. Just got the login alerts so I thought I'd check
[2019-12-16, 10:00:07 AM] Jamie: Haha sorry.
[2019-12-16, 10:00:36 AM] Jamie: Can you send me an email? I think I am getting them just can’t reply
[2019-12-16, 10:00:41 AM] Rob Feeny: All good, they're emails, just know you're in an area more prone to shit getting stolen!
[2019-12-16, 10:00:52 AM] Jamie: True
[2019-12-16, 10:03:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Done
[2019-12-16, 10:04:28 AM] Jamie: Yeah I got it but response is stuck in the outbox. Has to be a google problem as I have the same setup on jamie@feenypower.ca and it sends.
[2019-12-16, 10:04:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Strange. And jamie@feenypower.ca isn't powered by Google?
[2019-12-16, 10:05:36 AM] Jamie: Actually the feenypower email i sent just disappeared and didn’t arrive. I wonder if the router is blocking it. I will have to test somewhere else
[2019-12-16, 10:06:19 AM] Jamie: Ok it’s in my outbox. So both fail. I will try a different wifi
[2019-12-16, 7:15:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey man, you there?
[2019-12-16, 7:15:51 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2019-12-16, 7:18:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh I have to ask
[2019-12-16, 7:18:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Heard the news?
[2019-12-16, 7:19:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I wanted to check on you
[2019-12-16, 7:20:45 PM] Jamie: I did.
[2019-12-16, 7:21:03 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm here if you need to talk
[2019-12-16, 7:21:04 PM] Jamie: Appreciate that. It’s a shitty thing
[2019-12-16, 7:21:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah. I know she was someone you cared for
[2019-12-16, 7:22:04 PM] Jamie: Yeah I’m fine. I wasn’t even suprised to here it was Cassidy when I saw the article.
[2019-12-16, 7:22:36 PM] Jamie: You know some people you just feel won’t have a long life. I felt that with Cassidy.
[2019-12-16, 7:23:16 PM] Jamie: But she just was learning how to be happier so that is very sad
[2019-12-16, 7:23:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I think there are some people in life that have to make it past a certain point to be good for the rest of their life
[2019-12-16, 7:24:04 PM] Rob Feeny: And sadly she didn't
[2019-12-16, 7:25:31 PM] Rob Feeny: I think my friend Tori is the same way and hope she makes it past 25.
[2019-12-16, 7:25:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Anyhow, just wanted to see if you were ok. No need to dwell on it.
[2019-12-16, 7:26:17 PM] Jamie: Thanks
[2019-12-17, 1:17:26 PM] Jamie: Maybe to early to tell but stopping shampoo seems to have really helped. Maybe some small ones but not like before. It’s such a relief. I have to get my haircut and it’s always embarrassing.
[2019-12-17, 1:32:13 PM] Rob Feeny: That's awesome. Glad it's improved
[2019-12-17, 1:32:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you put a sunblock on your head?
[2019-12-17, 1:37:00 PM] Jamie: When surfing, yes. For short durations, no, but I bring a hat so if I get stuck in the sun I can cover my melon
[2019-12-17, 1:38:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I was just curious is the block was causing problems
[2019-12-17, 1:39:56 PM] Jamie: I don’t think so, but I still do it for surfing and it’s improving.
[2019-12-18, 10:36:03 AM] Jamie: Hey I remember your guacamole S being really good. What’s your recipe?
[2019-12-18, 10:39:10 AM] Rob Feeny: Super simple. Avocado, a small amount of onion diced finely, a small amount of tomato, diced, cilantro, salt and like juice
[2019-12-18, 10:39:21 AM] Rob Feeny: *lime
[2019-12-18, 10:39:31 AM] Rob Feeny: Sometimes I'll add a little chili powder
[2019-12-18, 10:42:59 AM] Jamie: Ok I think I should have cut the onions smaller, lol
[2019-12-18, 10:44:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah their alkalinity reacts with the acidity of the lime to make it a bit sweeter
[2019-12-18, 10:45:35 AM] Rob Feeny: Met Perry Yee the other day. Quite a character. And worked with Andy Swain of Imagine AV yesterday
[2019-12-18, 10:45:36 AM] Jamie: Cool thx
[2019-12-18, 10:45:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Tim's kinda shut down for the holidays
[2019-12-18, 10:45:51 AM] Jamie: Perry is great actually. Super nice guy
[2019-12-18, 10:46:29 AM] Rob Feeny: He's repping a bunch of brands now, working with Rolando on a job for his hockey people
[2019-12-21, 12:47:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I have a low voltage question. All the DC wire sourcing resources I am finding online are for solar and vehicles. They all say that for my LED lights in my shop I need really really thick wire (like 8ga). It about a 36' run from the power source to 2 strips that are about 90W total. I know that because it's a return path I need to double the length. But when I talk to Tim, he said due to "skin effect" I could run way more off the 16ga wire I put in. And I know we ran 16ga wire over a 200' distance for LED strips at one of his jobs...
[2019-12-21, 12:47:58 PM] Rob Feeny: So basically, how can I find exactly how many DC amps of lighting I can put through this 16ga wire?
[2019-12-21, 1:19:06 PM] Jamie: It gets tough when you go below 14 gauge. What you have to do is take the load, factor in the length, then size the wire for the adjusted load. I used to have a chart. 16 gauge, 36 feet for a 90w load is no problem.
[2019-12-21, 1:19:50 PM] Jamie: If you want more resources look up BK lighting and find some led strip lighting, then look at the transformers. Most have install instruction that show a chart for lengths.
[2019-12-21, 1:23:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok awesome thanks. I got some super intense lights (120 LEDs per meter) to light the shop
[2019-12-21, 1:23:58 PM] Rob Feeny: I made the mistake of taking the ADHD meds without food this morning (got distracted after). I'm jittery.
[2019-12-21, 1:24:58 PM] Jamie: I did that with zyban and I could feel it move through my veins. Creepy
[2019-12-21, 1:29:03 PM] Rob Feeny: But overall it's been good
[2019-12-21, 1:29:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Although who knows, it might be a placebo effect
[2019-12-21, 1:32:12 PM] Jamie: Happy to hear this Rob
[2019-12-21, 1:58:30 PM] Rob Feeny: By the way Wayne from Starbucks says hi
[2019-12-21, 2:00:44 PM] Jamie: Good old Wayne. Where you at today?
[2019-12-21, 2:01:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Was at Starbucks now I'm on the way to the Fortuga to do some work, get some stuff
[2019-12-21, 2:02:02 PM] Jamie: How’s it coming along? Love to see a pic of it lit up, surely you hacked an extension cord to supply power for testing, haha
[2019-12-21, 2:03:29 PM] Jamie: The high season is coming. The bikini clad women are starting to appear in the streets
[2019-12-21, 2:03:44 PM] Jamie: I love Argentinian women. They are so hot
[2019-12-21, 2:04:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha nice
[2019-12-21, 2:05:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh god yes. There's this girl, Agustina Capobianco from Argentina that I used to go to school with that is just unbelievable...
[2019-12-21, 2:05:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll send a few
[2019-12-21, 2:06:34 PM] Jamie: Tanned, tattooed, and great tits on a skinny frame. What’s not to like?
‎[2019-12-21, 2:07:39 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-12-21, 2:07:54 PM] Rob Feeny: All that German blended in...
[2019-12-21, 2:08:03 PM] Jamie: Yup
‎[2019-12-21, 8:56:44 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-12-21, 8:57:42 PM] Jamie: Very cool! Looks bright enough for sure
[2019-12-21, 8:57:57 PM] Rob Feeny: New lights are way better. That's 100W worth powered by a 15v, 5a power supply
[2019-12-21, 8:58:23 PM] Rob Feeny: So with a proper power supply they'll be better. Got a 360w power supply coming
[2019-12-21, 8:58:30 PM] Rob Feeny: And that's half of them
[2019-12-21, 8:58:58 PM] Jamie: Ha from aliexpress?
‎[2019-12-21, 8:59:04 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-12-21, 8:59:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep
[2019-12-21, 8:59:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Second ventilation fan is done too
[2019-12-21, 8:59:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Tied into the solar panel on the roof
[2019-12-21, 8:59:38 PM] Jamie: Sweet. So it runs when the panel gets sun?
[2019-12-21, 8:59:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Sadly despite all my work, I've got some minor leaks somewhere
[2019-12-21, 8:59:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Exactly
[2019-12-21, 9:00:16 PM] Jamie: Rainy vancouver will find all leaks!
[2019-12-21, 9:00:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Not sure if they're from condensation or the roof leaking. I thought I sealed it pretty well. I might cover the entire roof in stick-on vinyl.
[2019-12-21, 9:00:40 PM] Rob Feeny: It's cheap and wateright and flexes
‎[2019-12-21, 9:01:08 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2019-12-21, 9:01:55 PM] Jamie: Couldn’t even figure out what was happening here until I realized that the door had a mirror in it
[2019-12-21, 9:01:59 PM] Jamie: on*
[2019-12-21, 9:06:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Ohhh hahah yah it came from a yoga studio
[2019-12-22, 6:06:35 PM] Rob Feeny: How goes the battle with the ants
[2019-12-22, 6:07:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Man Google voice to text is just garbage. That took 7 try is to get it right
[2019-12-22, 6:26:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh and Morgan told me about Jesse yesterday. Blew my mind. So sad.
[2019-12-22, 7:16:33 PM] Jamie: Yeah, another good one didn’t make it. He was good to me
[2019-12-22, 7:17:26 PM] Jamie: Oil in a bowl worked, and putting all organics in the freezer
[2019-12-23, 4:22:13 PM] Jamie: I am just stunned at how cheap Dutch people are. How do they teach this? This girl walked up to me (she had been in the surf lessons for several weeks) and asked if she could get me to take some photos of her and her fiends with the drone. I said sure, sign up through the school and she said she doesn’t want to pay, it’s too expensive. $20, lol.
[2019-12-23, 4:53:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhhh the Dutch. They're a special breed. And rude af too!
[2019-12-23, 4:55:01 PM] Jamie: Yeah. I am rethinking working with the Spanish school because about 3/4 of their students are Dutch and I actually think that they don’t appreciate the value.
[2019-12-23, 4:56:38 PM] Jamie: It’s a lot of effort for people that don’t appreciate it.
[2019-12-24, 3:57:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah maybe focus your energy elsewhere. No need to cut it off, just leave is as an option?
[2019-12-24, 3:58:54 PM] Jamie: Probably right. Should have just taken the photo and used it as free advertisement. I react strongly to super cheap peolple, lol
[2019-12-24, 4:00:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. But they're not even worth your energy
[2019-12-24, 4:01:33 PM] Rob Feeny: I've got a super expensive suitcase for sale, $600. I am getting low-ball offers like $300. I used to get mad, now I just tell them to fuck off and block them 🤣
[2019-12-24, 4:06:09 PM] Jamie: Wankers. How’s Seattle?
‎[2019-12-24, 4:08:17 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2019-12-24, 4:13:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha that's a great shot
[2019-12-24, 4:13:32 PM] Rob Feeny: It's fun. Very chill.
[2019-12-24, 4:15:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Curtis's parents are here. Interesting crew
[2019-12-26, 3:15:05 PM] Jamie: So hard to deal with Latin people sometimes. This nice kid, server at a restaurant I frequent, was supposed to meet me so I could do a drone video and then we can analyze his surfing (unpaid). 2:30 on the beach in front of Hostel Bambino. At 3 I left. I don’t think he is being an asshole but I’m annoyed.
[2019-12-26, 3:16:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah only 30min late is nothing, he probably thought you weren't going to arrive until at least 3
[2019-12-26, 3:16:36 PM] Jamie: Easy to say, hey it’s Ecuador but that doesn’t change my frustration with the wasted time. And now what? Next time I see him, he won’t understand why I didn’t wait.
[2019-12-26, 3:16:49 PM] Rob Feeny: He's probably too young to be really aware of the differences between cultures, especially if he's never left his country
[2019-12-26, 3:17:11 PM] Rob Feeny: To him, he'll probably be really confused because you act totally different than someone from his culture
[2019-12-26, 3:17:38 PM] Rob Feeny: And to them, your actions would be strange and foreign
[2019-12-26, 3:17:39 PM] Jamie: I think in the future I will just say if you’re late I will leave so be on time
[2019-12-26, 3:18:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Try saying "German time". That's a term the Mexicans used a lot to mean "when I say 3 I mean 3"
[2019-12-26, 3:18:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Because you already know that if a local says 3 they mean anywhere between 330 and 5
[2019-12-26, 3:18:45 PM] Rob Feeny: And they would be neither offended or surprised if you showed up at 4
[2019-12-26, 3:19:21 PM] Rob Feeny: If someone there invited you to a party and you arrived at the time they said, they'd be shocked
[2019-12-26, 3:19:34 PM] Jamie: I understand all of this.
[2019-12-26, 3:20:16 PM] Rob Feeny: I think you mentally do but haven't really grasped the depth of it
[2019-12-26, 3:20:46 PM] Rob Feeny: You keep expecting them to act like Canadians
[2019-12-26, 3:20:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Or be aware that they're acting like Ecuadorians
[2019-12-26, 3:24:51 PM] Jamie: Yeah but that doesn’t work for me. I’m not going to sit and wait for an hour for anyone. Nor am i going to try to buffer to try to trick them to show up at a time I can predict. It might be the ecuadorian way but if they want something from me, they have to play by my rules. I will be clear that I will wait 15 minutes and then I leave.
[2019-12-26, 3:25:34 PM] Jamie: Once I set the expectations, I can remove the anger from it.
[2019-12-26, 3:25:59 PM] Rob Feeny: I don't know what to say man. You're in their country and as long as you mentally expect them to conform to the norms from your country you'll be unhappy with them
[2019-12-26, 3:28:10 PM] Jamie: Perhaps. I think there is a middle ground somewhere
[2019-12-26, 3:28:22 PM] Jamie: How’s Boxing Day treating you?
[2019-12-26, 3:31:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Pretty lazy. Dan, Janice and Elex are almost here
[2019-12-26, 3:31:33 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm almost ready to go home haha
[2019-12-26, 3:31:45 PM] Jamie: I bet. Stimulus overload!
[2019-12-26, 3:31:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Still hot and sunny there?
[2019-12-26, 3:31:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yah and between Laura, Cathy and Dean...
[2019-12-26, 3:32:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Dean is turning into a typical, afraid of every, American house wife
[2019-12-26, 3:32:36 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah, the sun is here.
[2019-12-26, 3:32:59 PM] Jamie: It’s a volatile group that’s for sure
[2019-12-26, 3:33:07 PM] Jamie: How do?
[2019-12-26, 3:33:14 PM] Jamie: So*
[2019-12-26, 3:35:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Just interesting to hear what has her stressed, like her fear of break-ins and n'erdo-wells prowling the neighborhood, the scary risky parts of her life like driving to Fred Meyers or having to drive on the freeway
[2019-12-26, 3:35:56 PM] Jamie: Curt does a good job of providing for her if that’s the most of her concerns.
[2019-12-26, 3:38:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh heck yah. It's interesting though because she lacks perspective about her situation and feels very hard-done-by. It can be hard to keep quiet when she talks about how rough bshe has it
[2019-12-26, 3:40:14 PM] Jamie: I bet. Although I miss you all, Christmas is very peaceful here without tons of family
[2019-12-26, 3:47:25 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet. It'd be nice to nap without Grace trying to cut my legs off with her new light saber
[2019-12-26, 3:47:49 PM] Jamie: Lol Grace i could probably handle. She’s got a clever sense of humour
[2019-12-26, 4:33:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey man, I realize you probably just wanted a sympathetic ear to vent to, one that understands your frustrations. I defaulted into "solve the problem" mode, not "listen to the frustrations" mode. Sorry if that wasn't what you were looking for.
[2019-12-26, 4:34:28 PM] Jamie: All good Rob. Appreciate you saying that
[2019-12-26, 4:34:54 PM] Jamie: I know the way it is, I just can’t figure how to have it sit well
[2019-12-26, 4:35:21 PM] Rob Feeny: I find it very understandable why the expats cluster together. We can understand eachother
[2019-12-26, 6:59:29 PM] Jamie: Looks like the kid got the time wrong and was there at just after 2 instead of 2:30. When he couldn’t find me he went in the water
[2019-12-26, 6:59:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha he just thought "oh well, he's gone native" 🤣
[2019-12-26, 7:01:13 PM] Rob Feeny: It's really hard for me there that they simply don't think they're wasting anyone's time or inconveniencing them. It's part of the reason that nobody complains when cashing a cheque takes 40min or the bus is 20min late. They just think "it's just the way it is, why bother trying to change it?"
[2019-12-26, 7:01:42 PM] Rob Feeny: I guess also they've never experienced a culture that IS on time or systems the DO work, so they can't imagine it?
[2019-12-26, 7:01:46 PM] Jamie: I admire their ability to take it all in stride
[2019-12-26, 7:02:41 PM] Rob Feeny: But for them, it's not taking it all in stride, it's just life.. kind of like someone who's never felt AC simply doesn't know what they're missing. Sweating incessantly is just the norm, so to them, they're not suffering
[2019-12-26, 7:03:27 PM] Rob Feeny: I think it's why moving up from a 3rd world country is WAY easier than moving down the ladder
[2019-12-26, 7:04:15 PM] Jamie: Haha isn’t that the truth

[2019-12-26, 7:07:14 PM] Jamie: Nice. I bet it’s awesome to have the van there
[2019-12-26, 7:07:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Now that I upgraded the insulation

[2019-12-26, 7:08:05 PM] Rob Feeny: And I've got a little electric heater
[2019-12-26, 7:15:17 PM] Jamie: Perfect. Cold there?
[2019-12-26, 7:15:55 PM] Rob Feeny: -3 last night
[2019-12-26, 7:16:01 PM] Jamie: Shiiiiiiiiit
[2019-12-26, 7:24:16 PM] Rob Feeny: We're taking the van to big white in January so I need to perfect the systems

[2019-12-26, 7:39:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Doesn't look so awful
[2019-12-26, 7:39:29 PM] Jamie: $5 burgers
[2019-12-26, 7:39:51 PM] Jamie: This place is owned by a Canadian guy named darcy around 60. Really like him
[2019-12-26, 7:47:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, hence the gluten free options haha
[2019-12-26, 7:49:43 PM] Rob Feeny: The crew is working on Xmas 2020 plans. How many beds do you have? Can you fit 13 of us? 🤣
[2019-12-26, 7:50:47 PM] Jamie: I’ll say yes and sort the details later, in true Latin style
[2019-12-26, 7:53:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect. We'll bring the chaos to you haha
[2020-01-02, 12:22:48 PM] Jamie: Very interesting. The ants eat the gecko poop. If I don’t clean the few little poops everyday eventually word gets out and 50 ants come for it. I think I have to find the borax
[2020-01-02, 1:43:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha little bastards. But at least they clean it up?
[2020-01-02, 1:44:15 PM] Rob Feeny: You can just buy ant poison, like Terro, at the ferretería, but the active ingredient is usually boric acid (borax)
[2020-01-02, 1:44:35 PM] Rob Feeny: And I found the ants in ESA liked honey better than whatever they use in Terro
[2020-01-02, 1:45:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Electrical question.. looking at an energy meter for the shop and they all seem to be 230V, even the ones that are marketed as 120v. What would happen if I ran 120 through a 230V meter?
[2020-01-02, 1:45:43 PM] Rob Feeny: C$ 12.91  10%OFF | Din rail single phase KWH meter two wire energy meter analog display 5(30)A 50HZ 120V Watt hour

[2020-01-02, 1:59:36 PM] Jamie: You know you can borrow one from the library right?
[2020-01-02, 2:00:25 PM] Jamie: This auto translation stuff pisses me off. Half my phone is in Spanish and never went back to English and so many results change everything over to Spanish, with Google or with safari doesn’t matter
[2020-01-02, 2:00:53 PM] Jamie: This one is 120v
[2020-01-02, 2:02:33 PM] Rob Feeny: It says 120v but all the images of it shownit with 230v printed on it
[2020-01-02, 2:03:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah but I'm looking at hooking my shop up to power where it's stored and he's worried about energy costs
[2020-01-02, 2:06:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Ever use google.com/ndr
[2020-01-02, 2:07:01 PM] Rob Feeny: I think it's ndr but it means no redirect
[2020-01-02, 2:07:14 PM] Rob Feeny: But search is so build in now that...
[2020-01-02, 2:07:16 PM] Jamie: Hmm. I will try
[2020-01-02, 2:07:19 PM] Rob Feeny: *built
[2020-01-02, 2:07:45 PM] Rob Feeny: 4 years later my YouTube is still in Spanish and I can't fix it
[2020-01-02, 2:08:25 PM] Jamie: Lol
[2020-01-02, 2:10:03 PM] Rob Feeny: There's no tech support number to call so... I've spent hours trying. Imagine a future where people's entire lives can fall into these glitches in the matrix...
[2020-01-02, 2:10:26 PM] Rob Feeny: No tech support line but all your government services are in yiddish
[2020-01-02, 2:31:37 PM] Jamie: Yeah. Maybe find a local equivalent and then ask them but don’t buy
[2020-01-02, 2:39:47 PM] Jamie: Ok a little research and it looks like the Schneider electric equivalent is rated 230v. Look for a neutral connection point to determine use for 120v
[2020-01-02, 2:40:46 PM] Jamie: It has to get power to run the electronics and I can’t see there being a 230v to 5v (electronics voltage) transformer built in so I would say it would work
[2020-01-02, 2:41:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok thanks, I'll read the specs on the Schneider one, still have the link?
[2020-01-02, 2:41:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Talked to Dad yet today?
[2020-01-02, 2:42:10 PM] Jamie: https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/PHA6516600/
[2020-01-02, 2:42:21 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2020-01-02, 2:43:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice. He's off shopping and we're waiting for a callbat
[2020-01-02, 2:43:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Callback
[2020-01-02, 2:43:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks for the Electrical help. I'm having fun learning about DIN rail stuff
[2020-01-02, 2:44:44 PM] Jamie: I actually like din rails. You can build a “black box” and mount / enclose all the parts really neatly
[2020-01-02, 2:45:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Totally. I recently did a doorbell/access control system that was designed to mount on rail and loved the idea. I'm surprised we don't do more with them
[2020-01-02, 2:45:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Especially inside Comms boxes
[2020-01-02, 2:46:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Like DIN rail mounted power supplies and connection blocks etc
[2020-01-02, 2:49:03 PM] Jamie: Yup. Would make lots of sense.
[2020-01-02, 2:49:14 PM] Jamie: Hey what’s the word for cashews or dates in Spanish?
[2020-01-02, 2:49:32 PM] Jamie: I looked them up but nobody knows what I am talking about.
[2020-01-02, 2:49:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Marañon
[2020-01-02, 2:50:03 PM] Rob Feeny: But there might be a local word
[2020-01-02, 2:50:14 PM] Rob Feeny: They grew a ton in El Salvador
[2020-01-02, 2:50:20 PM] Jamie: Dates or cashews?
[2020-01-02, 2:50:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Sorry that was cashews
[2020-01-02, 2:50:45 PM] Jamie: Ahh cashew apple, lol
[2020-01-02, 2:51:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Dates I'm not sure about I'd have to Google it, never saw them down there (they're middle eastern)
[2020-01-02, 2:51:56 PM] Jamie: Ok. Trying to find a sugar base for some snacks I want to make. Dates works really well to hold it all together and sweeten
[2020-01-02, 2:52:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Date would be Dátil
[2020-01-02, 2:52:26 PM] Rob Feeny: https://spanish.stackexchange.com/questions/2788/whats-the-translation-of-dates-as-a-fruit
[2020-01-02, 2:52:34 PM] Jamie: Wonder if I can mix tamarind and honey to create something
[2020-01-02, 2:52:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yah that would be damn tasty
[2020-01-02, 2:53:00 PM] Rob Feeny: You can buy blocks of just sweet tamarind goo
[2020-01-02, 2:53:01 PM] Jamie: Ever used tamarind?
[2020-01-02, 2:53:17 PM] Jamie: Yeah I saw it but I here it’s kind of sweet / sour
[2020-01-02, 2:53:21 PM] Jamie: hear*
[2020-01-02, 2:53:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes for cooking. Making tamarind water.
[2020-01-02, 2:53:34 PM] Rob Feeny: And yah it's got a unique taste but I like it
[2020-01-02, 2:53:49 PM] Jamie: Ok that might work then. I will try it
[2020-01-02, 2:55:12 PM] Jamie: Gonna make cheesecake bars out of oats / tamarind for the crust, then homemade almond butter, almond milk and raspberries. No cooking except roasting the almonds first. The refrigerate / freeze
[2020-01-02, 2:55:27 PM] Jamie: I don’t have an oven and want to make my own desserts here
[2020-01-02, 2:58:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Solar oven? Haha leave them outside in a black metal box...
[2020-01-02, 2:58:31 PM] Rob Feeny: (I'm only half joking)
[2020-01-02, 2:59:23 PM] Jamie: I thought about that but for toasting almonds that would be fine but no ability to regulate temperature would definitely fuck up my baking, lol
[2020-01-02, 2:59:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh, another tip I was going to give you for when you're struggling to find the proper translation for something...
[2020-01-02, 2:59:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Find the item on Wikipedia, the switch to the Spanish page about it
[2020-01-02, 2:59:53 PM] Rob Feeny: *then
[2020-01-02, 3:00:29 PM] Rob Feeny: It tends to have many different terms for it and as a last ditch effort you can just show that page to a Spanish speaker and they'll get what you're talking about much more quickly
[2020-01-02, 3:00:56 PM] Jamie: I’ll try it out. Thanks
[2020-01-02, 8:31:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you have a decent decibel meter app? Just tried 3 and they're useless (loads of full page popup ads)
[2020-01-02, 8:32:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Trying to measure the volume in my bedroom for Anna when she has parties. She's still pissed that I want a heads up before she has a rockband party in the room above my bedroom
[2020-01-02, 8:32:31 PM] Jamie: I have one called sound meter
[2020-01-02, 8:32:28 PM] Rob Feeny: *still pissy
‎[2020-01-02, 8:33:09 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-01-02, 8:37:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Great, nice and simple
[2020-01-02, 8:38:24 PM] Jamie: Yup. Used it at the hostel during santa semana. 91 DB in my bunk
[2020-01-02, 8:53:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch
[2020-01-07, 7:09:53 PM] Jamie: The worst thing about Ecuador is the laundry ladies steal my stuff. 2 shirts and face cloth so far and I have been super careful I thought
[2020-01-08, 12:12:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap. Do you have to make a list of what is in each load now?
[2020-01-08, 11:20:24 AM] Jamie: I think so. What can ya do?
‎[2020-01-08, 11:20:32 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-01-08, 11:20:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah it's too small a place to accuse them and lose access to laundry
[2020-01-08, 11:21:10 AM] Rob Feeny: but have you asked them about the shirts? At the very least it lets them know you know what's going on
[2020-01-08, 11:21:25 AM] Rob Feeny: damnnnn
[2020-01-08, 11:22:05 AM] Jamie: Yeah. I have pictures of everything so they will quickly realize I’m watching. Nicely. But it’s run by an entire family of about 6 so some are great and some are not.
[2020-01-08, 11:22:23 AM] Jamie: Amazing colours at that place
[2020-01-08, 11:22:32 AM] Jamie: How you doing Rob?
[2020-01-08, 11:23:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Yah could be on of the kids, if you showed the pic to the mom she might realize one of her kids is skimming stuff and box their ears
[2020-01-08, 11:23:50 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm reasonable. Living, enjoying Sheila, having some fun, doing some work
[2020-01-08, 11:24:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Looking forward to spring, the rain is killing me, but at least today its dry
[2020-01-08, 11:29:33 AM] Jamie: Haha true
[2020-01-08, 11:29:46 AM] Jamie: Happy to hear that is still working out
[2020-01-08, 11:31:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Went skiing monday, limped on tuesday haha
[2020-01-08, 11:31:22 AM] Rob Feeny: And how's life down south
[2020-01-08, 11:31:26 AM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2020-01-08, 11:33:21 AM] Jamie: Yeah that’s a tough sport for us elderly folk
[2020-01-08, 11:34:19 AM] Jamie: It good. Taking to a girl from Cuenca that was down here over New Years. If nothing develops, we are teaching each other our respective languages. She’s patient and nice with misunderstandings.
[2020-01-08, 11:36:00 AM] Jamie: Sold the first Montanita Spanish School surf video package last week for cash and did some electrical work at a coffee shop for coffee and cookies, working with the local real estate agent providing drone photos of the properties for cash. So I’m happy keeping busy
[2020-01-08, 11:36:12 AM] Jamie: And surfing almost each day.
[2020-01-08, 11:36:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha Electrical work for coffee and cookies, love it
[2020-01-08, 11:36:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Cute?
[2020-01-08, 11:37:04 AM] Jamie: Gonna set up the new POS software for the coffee shop too, building all the products and costs into it so he can track the costs and get some numbers
[2020-01-08, 11:38:03 AM] Jamie: Yes I think so. From Venezuela, very Latin featured but she has something about her for sure
[2020-01-08, 11:38:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice
[2020-01-08, 11:38:27 AM] Jamie: More importantly, she’s not afraid to express her interest
[2020-01-08, 11:38:31 AM] Rob Feeny: Sounds like fun tinkering work
[2020-01-08, 11:38:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Jajajaj Esooooo (This!)
[2020-01-08, 11:39:43 AM] Jamie: And I want to see the numbers. He has talked about selling half of it to clear some old debts back home so maybe a future business opportunity as well.
[2020-01-08, 11:39:49 AM] Jamie: But I want real numbers
[2020-01-08, 11:40:26 AM] Rob Feeny: Good call...
[2020-01-08, 11:44:45 AM] Jamie: And I’m getting good at photo shop

[2020-01-08, 11:49:01 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha crazy. What'd you do to that guy's tail?
[2020-01-08, 12:04:44 PM] Jamie: It was like that. Little baby. Gonna photo shop a rail on but I need a pattern model so I’m waiting to snap another photo.
‎[2020-01-08, 12:04:48 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-01-08, 12:04:54 PM] Jamie: This guys next
[2020-01-08, 12:07:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Freaky
[2020-01-11, 8:23:27 PM] Jamie: Well I am developing a thinker skin.  I met a nice girl where I drink my coffee in the morning and she showing out three days in a row when you fed wonderful conversations. So I invited her for dinner and live music with my friends were playing some blues tonight LOL and then I got a text from her saying she wouldn’t be able to stay long because she got invited to go to Montanita for some drinks and then she told me that she had already eaten and was just coming for a beer.
[2020-01-11, 8:24:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Local girl?
[2020-01-11, 8:24:14 PM] Jamie: Israelí actually.
[2020-01-11, 8:24:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm how old?
[2020-01-11, 8:24:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Sad how flakey women can be
[2020-01-11, 8:24:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Back in a while though, Sheila is waiting for me
[2020-01-12, 12:27:23 AM] Rob Feeny: You still awake?
[2020-01-12, 12:52:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Still working on dates. I want to stay longer than Dad but he'd be leaving probably the last day before Semana Santa (3rd). If I stay longer do you have room for me or do you have friends joining?
[2020-01-12, 12:53:15 AM] Rob Feeny: If I have to try to find accommodations for it, I probably won't stick around 🤣
[2020-01-12, 12:53:22 AM] Rob Feeny: Been there, done that hassle
[2020-01-12, 9:17:44 AM] Jamie: Once dad is gone, the room is your
[2020-01-12, 9:17:48 AM] Jamie: yours*
[2020-01-12, 11:23:13 AM] Jamie: Check out hostel bambino. Right on the ocean and suprisingly, still a good deal. Maybe $12-15 ($10 in the off season) a room. Not much for a kitchen but you can cook here
[2020-01-12, 12:39:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok thanks. And what are your thoughts on a 1hr 20min layover in DFW? It's that or picking a more expensive 19 or 22hr return flight
[2020-01-12, 12:40:18 PM] Jamie: I’m not sure. I haven’t flown into that airport too many times. Mostly Houston or LAX these days
[2020-01-12, 12:41:13 PM] Jamie: I wouldn’t pick the flight myself though. I would rather sit a few more hours in the airport than have to reschedule in the middle of a multi leg trip
[2020-01-12, 12:41:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Ever missed your connection due to customs?
[2020-01-12, 12:41:49 PM] Jamie: Nope.
[2020-01-12, 12:45:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm reading online seems to say that the airline will book you on a later flight out of courtesy but not cover accommodations etc
[2020-01-12, 12:45:38 PM] Rob Feeny: I guess it comes down to what Dad wants to do. It pushes the price of the flight over $1000 but there aren't any other options
[2020-01-12, 12:46:30 PM] Rob Feeny: In your experience, how long has it taken for your first connection in the US when leaving Ecuador?
[2020-01-12, 12:46:58 PM] Jamie: I think if you start on an American carrier, you will be fine. The only worries would be having the flight delayed (could happen on any flight) or having to go through security in Dallas.
[2020-01-12, 12:47:20 PM] Jamie: 1.5 hrs
[2020-01-12, 12:47:54 PM] Jamie: But depends the time too. Middle of the day is a gong show but late night was pretty quick
[2020-01-12, 12:48:40 PM] Jamie: And sometimes, I think most times. ... my luggage goes all the way and I don’t have to go through security. Have no idea why though
[2020-01-12, 12:49:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yahhhh I had this problem in El Salvador. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't
[2020-01-12, 12:51:42 PM] Rob Feeny: The flight leaves at 1:40am, I'll check when it arrives
[2020-01-12, 12:52:54 PM] Jamie: How much connection time do you have in the way back?
[2020-01-12, 12:53:30 PM] Rob Feeny: That is the way back. On the way down they're also 1:20 and 1:30
[2020-01-12, 12:57:31 PM] Jamie: I think you just have to trust in the system. There will be others with the same issues and maybe close connection is a reason why the luggage goes direct
[2020-01-12, 12:58:13 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm not super worried, it's Dad

[2020-01-12, 12:59:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm customs in DFW would be at 8am 😬
[2020-01-12, 1:00:50 PM] Rob Feeny: otherwise it looks like he could do a 22hr flight with a 7hr layover in Dallas and 2.5hr layover in LA
[2020-01-12, 1:01:50 PM] Jamie: It’s only a single flight from Dallas to Vancouver with no other dependant flights. and he would have all day to find another flight. Worst case. I really think it will be fine.
[2020-01-12, 1:02:04 PM] Jamie: It’s not like short layover in Panama with two other flights dependent on it or something like that
[2020-01-12, 1:02:36 PM] Jamie: Gonna lose wifi for a bit here
[2020-01-12, 1:02:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, we can see what he says. The flights are slightly different than last night too
[2020-01-12, 2:52:44 PM] Rob Feeny: The flights change everytime we look, so I'm going to try again tomorrow. This morning there were good options for Dad to travel the 22nd to 3rd and I would stay until the 6th, we'd both have a 15 our trip down and 12hr trip home, but that doesn't seem to be available anymore
[2020-01-14, 12:29:17 PM] Jamie: Just got an email from dad, he’s not coming so obviously that room is yours now. Might simplified everything.  I could tell he was stressed about it
[2020-01-14, 12:29:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah he just messaged me this am
[2020-01-14, 12:29:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Shame, it would have been a cool adventure
[2020-01-14, 12:32:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I guess part of it was the fact that there was no way to book a flight without either short layovers or very long transit times (except paying $3k)
[2020-01-14, 12:38:24 PM] Jamie: True
[2020-01-14, 12:38:35 PM] Jamie: You still gonna come at the same time?
[2020-01-14, 12:39:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I think so. It actually simplifies things for me a lot. I wanted to go to Peru afterwards to see a friend and strangely when I did a multicity flight I couldn't get the same flights as Dad on the way to Ecuador
[2020-01-14, 12:39:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Adding the stop in Peru on the way home actually only adds like $25 to the price?!
[2020-01-14, 12:40:17 PM] Jamie: Wow. It’s at least $45 plus 20 hrs on the bus
[2020-01-14, 12:47:39 PM] Rob Feeny: ok, it' changed again, but the entire trip is $1,007. I was looking at taking a $900 flight so...
[2020-01-14, 12:48:17 PM] Jamie: Well if your a gambler you can set Ane alert if it drops...
[2020-01-14, 12:48:29 PM] Jamie: you’re*
[2020-01-14, 12:49:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I might just check every day and see if it drops a bit then grab it
[2020-01-14, 12:49:30 PM] Rob Feeny: shame, I was looking forward to showing Dad another part of my personality/abilities
[2020-01-14, 12:50:36 PM] Jamie: Yeah me too. Unfortunate, and a little odd because there are many elderly Canadians that come here each year. But that heart attack shook him. And Cathy
[2020-01-14, 12:51:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I definitely thought there was a lot of Cathy in that decision. Hence the going down with me helping but..
[2020-01-14, 12:52:27 PM] Rob Feeny: I feel bad that I wasn't wanting to do the return portion with him as well but originally he was talking about 9 days in the country and it's enough of an investment for me that I wanted more
[2020-01-14, 12:52:34 PM] Rob Feeny: and I think the return is the part that stresses him more
[2020-01-14, 12:53:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I wonder if maybe I sorted it so I started in Peru and did the return leg with him?
[2020-01-14, 12:54:11 PM] Jamie: Nah the decision was made a while ago deep down I think. He put off several times so this has been sitting a while. I would imagine it’s a relief to finally make the decision so let’s not put him back in that spot.
[2020-01-14, 12:54:46 PM] Jamie: He is face to face with his age and vulnerability right now and it’s probably not a great spot
[2020-01-14, 1:08:19 PM] Rob Feeny: C'est la vie. Now I just have to decide when I want to travel (and whether I want to be in Latin America during Semana Santa
[2020-01-14, 1:08:40 PM] Rob Feeny: I might do my dental work in Peru, if Yeissi knows a good dentist there
[2020-01-14, 1:09:04 PM] Rob Feeny: I wish I could bring Sheila on the adventure but she doesn't graduate until May
[2020-01-14, 5:39:15 PM] Rob Feeny: So I know in ESA & México, Semana Santa was basically 9 days, the two weekends and the week in between
[2020-01-14, 5:40:03 PM] Rob Feeny: If dad's not coming, I'm looking at going to Peru, getting my teeth fixed there at a friend's dentist, visiting with her then coming to Ecuador for a visit, hoping to do part of it before Semana Santa and then enjoy some of the craziness
[2020-01-14, 5:40:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you have any plans around then I should work around? You ok with me in your room for Semana Santa or did you have friends coming or want to rent it?
[2020-01-14, 7:06:59 PM] Jamie: Nope. It’s yours
[2020-01-14, 7:08:34 PM] Jamie: So what days would you be here?
[2020-01-14, 7:09:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Just working on sorting that out
[2020-01-14, 7:10:10 PM] Rob Feeny: But maybe leaving the 7th?
[2020-01-14, 7:13:51 PM] Jamie: Of April. Ok works for me.
[2020-01-14, 7:14:40 PM] Jamie: And just you know, we have another roommate.
[2020-01-14, 7:15:09 PM] Jamie: It’s a rooster and I think he lives on the roof.
[2020-01-14, 7:15:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha fucking gallo
[2020-01-14, 7:16:13 PM] Jamie: It’s ok. He’s only really active from 3am to 7am
[2020-01-14, 7:16:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh wonderful. So much for the sunrise thing
[2020-01-15, 1:35:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok so I have a pretty good flight option, putting me in Guayaquil on March 29th and then flying out on the 9th
[2020-01-15, 1:37:37 PM] Rob Feeny: That gives me 9 nights in Olon/Montañita
[2020-01-15, 1:37:44 PM] Jamie: Great
[2020-01-15, 1:38:17 PM] Rob Feeny: And I'll have 4 nights in Peru before that. Was tempted to add Quito as well to visit a friend but it's another $200
[2020-01-15, 3:52:11 PM] Jamie: Got your itinerary. Looks good, that’s exciting!
[2020-01-15, 4:19:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, just under $1000
[2020-01-15, 4:19:34 PM] Rob Feeny: It was about $180 to go to Lima but it'll be worth it
‎[2020-01-18, 11:54:34 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-01-18, 2:54:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok just skiing, will later today
[2020-01-18, 2:54:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks
[2020-01-19, 12:56:56 PM] Jamie: Know anything about exporting from South America?
[2020-01-19, 1:05:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Not really. I know a few people that have some experience. What are you looking at bringing in?
[2020-01-19, 1:15:22 PM] Jamie: Coffee beans. They grow a couple hours away from here and are suprisingly good. One of the coffee shops here, Australian guy, wants to look at exporting
[2020-01-20, 12:39:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh sweet. For a bit I was looking at bringing in coffee from El Salvador with Franco but he flaked out
[2020-01-21, 2:38:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Looks like Rob Autar is shutting down his showroom.
[2020-01-21, 6:26:15 PM] Jamie: Oh shit. Wonder how much he owes Morgan.  Is it official?
[2020-01-21, 6:27:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I drove past last night and it's getting emptied. He's not shuttering the business, just won't have a showroom
[2020-01-21, 6:27:46 PM] Rob Feeny: But he owes Morgan a lot and me a couple grand
[2020-01-22, 6:37:22 PM] Jamie: Crazy. He must have a storage space to work out of at least. That’s some serious gear that needs a place. Fire sale for your place!
[2020-01-22, 6:37:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I don't trust that guy at all. But I suppose I could take gear in lieu of payment

[2020-01-24, 3:20:07 PM] Jamie: Hey ant whisperer. These little fuckers seem to just be deviating around the Borax and honey. Any other ideas?
[2020-01-24, 3:20:18 PM] Jamie: Brutal
[2020-01-24, 3:22:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha maybe find another sweet thing they like and mix the borax in?
[2020-01-24, 3:22:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Basically watch what they eat.. or mix less in?
[2020-01-24, 3:25:58 PM] Jamie: Does it take a while for them to carry it back to the nest?
[2020-01-24, 3:26:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah, but usually I just put one drop and tiny little Argentinian ants would carry it off within about 48hrs
‎[2020-01-24, 5:08:44 PM] Jamie: ‎video omitted
[2020-01-24, 6:00:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha awesome
[2020-01-27, 3:10:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I'm pretty sure those are the same ants I fought with. Highly invasive Argentinian ants. Multiple queens in supercolonies that can span city blocks
[2020-01-27, 3:11:02 PM] Rob Feeny: You can keep the numbers down but you'll never be free. But regularly dosing them with borax should help a lot
[2020-01-27, 3:11:04 PM] Jamie: Yeah they were everywhere
[2020-01-27, 3:11:19 PM] Jamie: Not at my place, at a coffee shop so
[2020-01-27, 3:11:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh so you helped them out? or?
[2020-01-27, 3:13:36 PM] Jamie: Yeah we mixed honey and borax and created some air gaps to the sweets. For a day nothing, then they swarmed and tries to take all the borax, ha. Now it seems like not many of them are left
[2020-01-27, 3:14:28 PM] Rob Feeny: it's slower acting but they feed it to the queen. The only issue is that those guys have multiple queens. If you stop putting it out, they rebuild the hive
[2020-01-27, 3:14:59 PM] Rob Feeny: But they never stopped eating it, for me, so being diligent kept out house free. Graz's parents' place was always crawling wiht them and it grossed me out
[2020-01-27, 3:21:02 PM] Jamie: Yeah they don’t bother me at my place so much because I am crazy about keeping the food in the fridge or freezer
[2020-01-27, 3:21:54 PM] Jamie: So... I dislocated my shoulder last week. Pretty bad actually. Gonna be about 6-12 weeks recovery and up to 6 months for full use, so I am told
[2020-01-27, 3:23:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy shit
[2020-01-27, 3:23:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Sooooo you going to come back early?

[2020-01-27, 3:24:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Is that a break? or just dislocation? I don't know the shoulder well enough to know how it SHOULD look!
[2020-01-27, 3:24:25 PM] Jamie: No. I have over 3 months left and I think I can rehab it and get back surfing faster than if I go home.
‎[2020-01-27, 3:25:18 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-01-27, 3:26:16 PM] Jamie: Those two pieces are connected by a tendon not bone
[2020-01-27, 3:28:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Horrible man. Did it surfing?
[2020-01-27, 3:28:48 PM] Rob Feeny: At least massage etc is cheap down there and you have time for rehab
[2020-01-27, 3:29:10 PM] Rob Feeny: If you need to connect with a physio here in canada for advice, like 3 of my friends gradded from UBC physio program
[2020-01-27, 3:30:09 PM] Jamie: No. Playing football (soccer) on the beach and stumbled, rolled on my shoulder but the impact on the wet sand did some damage
[2020-01-27, 3:31:10 PM] Jamie: I would take all the advice possible. One of the people here was a physio from the Netherlands and another an ER doc from Vancouver. They both agree with the doctors here as to the damage and treatment. But more is better...
[2020-01-27, 3:31:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Have you ever met my friend Sam Smith? The gymnast?
[2020-01-27, 3:31:59 PM] Jamie: Oh yeah. Bunch of times
[2020-01-27, 3:34:04 PM] Rob Feeny: That's who I was thinking of
[2020-01-27, 3:38:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Sent her a Whatsapp message
[2020-01-27, 3:57:45 PM] Rob Feeny: btw there's a small chance Sheila could come for part of my time in Ecuador. Would you be comfortable with that?
[2020-01-27, 3:58:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Looking forward to hanging out with you and I know it would change the dynamic
[2020-01-27, 3:58:26 PM] Rob Feeny: SHe has her practicum (she shadows someone for 3 months) and the person is taking 2 weeks off righ then
[2020-01-27, 4:00:05 PM] Jamie: Sure.
[2020-01-27, 4:06:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Actually? Haha she's worried it would change the vibe of the trip a lot
[2020-01-27, 4:06:36 PM] Rob Feeny: And I've got no issue if so, is only a possibility atm
[2020-01-27, 4:07:43 PM] Jamie: It would. But who’s to say that would be a bad thing? I’m sure it would be fine, she can help pick up women for me
[2020-01-27, 4:08:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha she's an amazing wingwoman
[2020-01-27, 4:08:53 PM] Rob Feeny: We'll discuss it
[2020-01-28, 12:15:36 AM] Rob Feeny: ugh. Latam cancelled one leg of my return flight. Flighthub is offering me an alternative that flies me to Chile then back to Vancouver, taking 28hrs
[2020-01-28, 12:57:58 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha, I gave up on Flighthub, called Latam directly, then chose the "travel agency" line.. hahah then I told the guy "The travel agency said they couldn't help me and to try you"
[2020-01-28, 12:58:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Got a better return flight than I started with, leaving guayaquil at 6am and getting to Van at 10pm, through Mexico city with a better ticket (meals & drinks included!)
[2020-01-28, 2:15:24 PM] Jamie: Nice work! Hope they don’t change it again. They moved Myles off the business class seats and he’s pissed
[2020-01-28, 2:16:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Did he pay for them or just get an upgrade?
[2020-01-28, 2:16:29 PM] Jamie: It’s what was offered and he booked it
[2020-01-28, 2:16:36 PM] Jamie: But no, he didn’t pay
[2020-01-28, 2:16:40 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm just happy I don't have to stop in the US at all during my whole trip
[2020-01-28, 2:17:23 PM] Rob Feeny: I think my Aeromexico flights are expensive ones, but since Latam straight up cancelled my one flight, it looks like their system allows them to book anything as a replacement, regardless of cost
[2020-01-28, 2:17:53 PM] Jamie: That’s pretty sweet
[2020-01-28, 2:20:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I'm stoked
[2020-01-28, 2:21:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Sheila is really stressing about changing the vibe of my trip so I basically said we'd let it percolate for a bit before deciding. Was thinking she could join for the Ecuador portion (Peru will be more about getting things done) but we'll see. I'd love to show off my skills haha but also space apart is healthy
[2020-01-28, 2:21:32 PM] Rob Feeny: It's crazy tho man. I've never been in a healthier or happier relationship
[2020-01-28, 2:21:35 PM] Jamie: Tell not to stress on my behalf
[2020-01-28, 2:21:42 PM] Jamie: That’s great
[2020-01-28, 2:22:39 PM] Rob Feeny: We had a long-overdue talk about what we're looking for (in a relationship, life, career) and it was eye opening. We're very well aligned. I even made us write it down in advance and compare, so neither of us influenced the other
[2020-01-28, 2:23:17 PM] Rob Feeny: She's had a fascinating life and I love her small-town vancouver island values 🤣
[2020-01-29, 6:37:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok she's booking a ticket
[2020-01-30, 12:31:11 PM] Rob Feeny: And stupid United won't let me use my credit on her flight because one of her flights isn't with United
[2020-01-30, 12:31:31 PM] Jamie: Yeah I had the same problem.
[2020-01-30, 12:32:08 PM] Rob Feeny: All good tho, I love a good fight
[2020-01-30, 12:34:33 PM] Jamie: Haha.
[2020-01-30, 12:36:14 PM] Rob Feeny: She's flying in 3 hours after me and leaving the night before (I fly out at 6am)
[2020-01-30, 12:36:39 PM] Rob Feeny: And she's definitely down for wingwomaning, I'll tell her to leave some girls for you
[2020-01-30, 12:37:28 PM] Jamie: It’s very low on my priority list
[2020-01-30, 12:37:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Fighting United or chasing girls?
[2020-01-30, 12:38:05 PM] Jamie: Chasing girls. I would fuck up united ROAR!!
[2020-01-30, 12:39:14 PM] Rob Feeny: lol. You can't even call them, it's idiotic. I keep the poor reservations manager on the phone for 30min just talking in circles and telling her I wasn't hanging up until I spoke with a human at their service department
[2020-01-30, 12:39:20 PM] Rob Feeny: *kept
[2020-01-30, 1:24:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Am I a terrible person for leaving the conversation about Mom? Even muting it was stressing me out
[2020-01-30, 2:03:55 PM] Jamie: Well, if even the conversation stresses you out 10 years later, maybe there is something that needs to be addressed. Guilt? Anger? I don’t know man. I think only you should do what’s healthiest for you and I’m not sure if this way is solving anything. There’s no right answer but I don’t think less of you
[2020-01-30, 2:07:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, thanks. I really have found the only way to handle her is no contact. It's a huge trigger, but I did spend probably the longest amount of time living with her of any of the kids
[2020-01-30, 2:11:30 PM] Jamie: What does Sheila say about it?
[2020-01-30, 2:13:33 PM] Rob Feeny: She doesn't know the situation well, but understands cutting off contact, she did that when her parents wouldn't accept her bisexuality or relationship. She was then hard-ass on them when they reached out again, giving them brutal honesty, then leaving them to stew on what would be involved in rebuilding the relationship
[2020-01-30, 2:13:58 PM] Rob Feeny: They put the work in, but to be honest I really don't see mom as willing or capable of doing something like that
[2020-01-30, 2:14:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Scary though because now that the relationship is regrowing (it started as a close one because she was an only child) her dad's health is really bad. He has a triple bypass and heart muscle graft scheduled for next week 😬
[2020-01-30, 2:15:08 PM] Rob Feeny: He's older than Dad despite her being 13yrs younger than ne
[2020-01-30, 2:15:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Anyhow I've basically told her that she'll never meet mom
[2020-01-31, 12:00:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Man it can be hard to take the neverending rain here
[2020-01-31, 12:00:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Soak up some sun for me
‎[2020-01-31, 12:04:57 PM] Jamie: ‎video omitted
[2020-01-31, 12:08:19 PM] Jamie: Hopefully this helps.
[2020-01-31, 12:08:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh damn
[2020-01-31, 12:09:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to trade for traffic and rain?
[2020-01-31, 3:38:27 PM] Rob Feeny: This is mostly how I'm coping with the gloom 🤣 I bought them for night driving and actually love them on gloomy days
[2020-01-31, 3:38:44 PM] Jamie: Whatever works right?
[2020-01-31, 3:39:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Got lights and glasses. It helps a lot. It's been worse than usual this year. I need to get up into the mountains, above the clouds
[2020-01-31, 3:40:05 PM] Rob Feeny: How's the shoulder?
[2020-01-31, 3:41:29 PM] Jamie: Pretty tough mentally. Healing in or ahead of schedule but apparently it will heal asymmetrical.
‎[2020-01-31, 3:41:46 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-01-31, 3:42:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Seriously? Nothing you can do about that?
[2020-01-31, 3:43:59 PM] Jamie: Well without surgery, there is no way to bring the scapula and the clavicle closer together. The tendons are completely torn. I got some physio tape to try to pull it up while the tendons heal but it can only do so much
‎[2020-01-31, 3:44:13 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-01-31, 3:45:19 PM] Jamie: Bottom right. The healing tendons will fill the gap but won’t pull the clavicle back down or the scapula up.
[2020-01-31, 3:51:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow. Are you considering coming back for surgery then?
[2020-01-31, 3:52:06 PM] Rob Feeny: I messaged Sam but haven't heard back, she's pretty busy, about to head to Azerbaijan to compete
[2020-01-31, 3:53:58 PM] Jamie: No.  I don’t think that they will do it. My understanding is that it is considered cosmetic and the shoulder should have full functionality without surgery. Some people have paid to remove the bump by shaving the clavicle but I wouldn’t pay for that.
[2020-01-31, 3:54:44 PM] Jamie: I know several surfer that have this injury and their shoulders are uneven. It’s a very common snowboarding / mountain biking injury
[2020-01-31, 3:56:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Crap. How does that affect you mentally?
[2020-01-31, 3:57:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok this pic is a mirror image right, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around which shoulder is the damaged one. The one closest to the door?
[2020-01-31, 3:58:08 PM] Jamie: Haha yes it’s a mirror image. And yes closest to the door.
[2020-01-31, 4:00:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Can you do the other one too to even out? 🤣
‎[2020-01-31, 4:01:49 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-01-31, 4:02:56 PM] Jamie: It’s hard to believe I will be able to surf again. And that there is not more I can do but wait
[2020-01-31, 4:06:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm really sorry to hear it man. You're dedicated enough that I know you'll fully recover but..
[2020-01-31, 4:09:33 PM] Jamie: I think once I get past the stage of lying in bed most of the day, it will be better. Right now I leave for about 2 hrs at a time, then back to listen to audio books on my back so gravity doesn’t make it lower while it heals. Also got physio tape and I’m using that to try to lift the shoulder by the deltoid. That helps a bunch I think. One more week of rest like this, with mobility work each morning and then I will start to build strength
[2020-01-31, 4:10:03 PM] Jamie: And tomorrow I will go in the ocean to gently swim. Can’t wait!
[2020-01-31, 4:10:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Glad you have a plan. At least you don't have to try to work while you heal

[2020-02-03, 4:29:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Here's the ying to your beach yabg
[2020-02-03, 4:29:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Yang
[2020-02-03, 4:32:53 PM] Jamie: Nice.  Looks cold
[2020-02-03, 4:42:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Pretty damn cold, until you spend an hour skinning back up again to ski down again
[2020-02-03, 4:45:31 PM] Jamie: Lol that will work up a sweat
[2020-02-05, 12:59:35 PM] Rob Feeny: So I might be able to buy another van fairly cheap, $6500 from a guy who has to leave the country. I'm seriously tempted, because if I could get a second van on the road for the summer,   it would pay for itself and then some. I can make it work but it would leave me completely tapped out. Any interest in investing / loaning me funds to make it happen in exchange for a share in profits/use of the van when you're in the country?
[2020-02-05, 1:05:24 PM] Jamie: Sure
[2020-02-05, 1:07:35 PM] Jamie: Hmm the only issue is I don’t think I can instruct my guy to deposit it except through Dad, who is out of country. I have maybe 3k available in my Canadian account. Let me know if I should inquire about getting more quickly.
[2020-02-05, 1:32:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I think I can pay for it, I'd just have nothing left to do repairs/live haha but that part isn't a rush. And of Morgan would pay me....
[2020-02-05, 1:34:35 PM] Jamie: Hopefully we are closing on a big lighting company job any day
[2020-02-05, 1:37:31 PM] Rob Feeny: You and Morgan?
[2020-02-05, 1:38:01 PM] Jamie: Yeah. One we looked at before I left.
[2020-02-05, 1:38:20 PM] Jamie: *lighting control
[2020-02-05, 1:40:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh awesome. He's been telling me about a big job he's about to get the down payment on for the last 2 months 🤣
[2020-02-05, 1:41:18 PM] Jamie: That’s the job. Richard Rusk said it would start immediately and then went on vacation for a month
[2020-02-05, 1:51:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha lovely that made for a tough Christmas for Morgan
‎[2020-02-05, 3:02:59 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-02-05, 3:08:31 PM] Jamie: Holy
[2020-02-05, 3:09:08 PM] Rob Feeny: She's a beast!
[2020-02-08, 12:31:05 PM] Rob Feeny: So I think I'm going to travel with my old MacBook, use it on the trip then sell it there before I leave. Know anyone looking for a good, reliable laptop? It needs a charger (I'll bring my new charger and bring it home with me) and the battery only lasts about 1.5hrs but it's a mid-2009 MBP, I replaced the HDD with a solid state drive and maxed out the RAM to 8gb
[2020-02-08, 12:32:21 PM] Jamie: Hmm not really. But there is a Facebook group for Olón you could post in. I keep my ears open
[2020-02-11, 10:10:13 AM] Jamie: So Myles is having a rough time. Flight was returned to terminal in New York, got a flight 24 hrs later and they lost his bag.
[2020-02-11, 10:11:04 AM] Jamie: I’m really nervous about having him here because he has no tolerance for a  country like this.
[2020-02-11, 10:30:09 AM] Rob Feeny: I think you just have to be firm.
[2020-02-11, 10:30:21 AM] Rob Feeny: His happiness is not your problem
[2020-02-11, 10:55:58 AM] Jamie: True
[2020-02-11, 10:57:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Is he going to have to wait in Guayaquil for his bag? Sheila and I are only bringing carry-on for that reason
[2020-02-11, 11:34:14 AM] Jamie: No apparently they will deliver it
[2020-02-11, 11:34:46 AM] Rob Feeny: I just don't think he's someone I'd have stay with me again
[2020-02-11, 11:35:01 AM] Jamie: He was carry on only buy with the delayed flight, he went to a hotel. He has my 2 bottles of bourbon and thought he might have them dumped by security so he checked his bag
[2020-02-11, 11:35:19 AM] Jamie: Yeah we shall see what happens.
[2020-02-11, 11:36:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm so a bag with 2 bottles of bourbon went missing hey?
[2020-02-11, 11:42:23 AM] Jamie: Yeah exactly. Couldn’t they have just taken the bottles?
[2020-02-11, 11:43:53 AM] Rob Feeny: They needed something to carry them in? And honestly, it is probably less  heatscore if the whole bag goes AWOL instead of something in a bag going missing
[2020-02-11, 11:44:11 AM] Jamie: True. How’s your day in Vancouver?
[2020-02-11, 11:46:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Pretty low key. Sitting on my couch watching netflix and doing bookkeeping w/ PartyCat
[2020-02-11, 11:46:13 AM] Jamie: Not bad for a Tuesday
[2020-02-11, 11:46:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice and low key. Sheila had her first shift of her Preceptorship (practicum) last night and so she's sleeping all day
[2020-02-11, 11:47:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Work is scarce these days tho
[2020-02-11, 11:47:41 AM] Jamie: Nothing with Tim or Rolando?
[2020-02-11, 12:18:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Not a whit. Nor with Morgan, WAV Rob, Imagine AV or Josh Wright.. a bit with Ben for Tiny House stuff
[2020-02-11, 12:18:46 PM] Rob Feeny: But bookings are happening for the van. Someone is coming Friday to see about booking the month of May
[2020-02-11, 12:18:54 PM] Rob Feeny: How's Recovery?
[2020-02-11, 12:22:29 PM] Jamie: Nice!
[2020-02-11, 12:22:39 PM] Jamie: What happened with the other one?
[2020-02-11, 12:23:28 PM] Jamie: 3 weeks in, still having trouble even swimming breaststroke.
[2020-02-11, 12:28:36 PM] Rob Feeny: It's booked. 2 weeks in July/Aug
[2020-02-11, 12:28:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Slow and steady. It was a big trauma...
[2020-02-11, 12:29:07 PM] Jamie: You bought the second van?
[2020-02-11, 12:29:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh sorry, I thought you meant the other booking
[2020-02-11, 12:29:54 PM] Rob Feeny: The other van was being sold by some weirdo, he was all keen, I arranged an inspection and everything and then crickets...
[2020-02-11, 12:30:17 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm keeping my eyes open and have some searches running on Craigslist
[2020-02-11, 12:30:22 PM] Jamie: Probably better that way
[2020-02-11, 12:31:52 PM] Rob Feeny: My thoughts exactly. Didn't know if I could trust him etc
[2020-02-11, 12:32:02 PM] Rob Feeny: And honestly with zero money coming in...
[2020-02-11, 12:32:18 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm putting out a lot of feelers, branching out a bunch
[2020-02-11, 12:32:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Might pull some HVAC wire for Andy
[2020-02-11, 12:32:34 PM] Rob Feeny: (Andrew Rankin)
[2020-02-11, 12:32:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Andy Swain is a mess (Imagine AV)
[2020-02-11, 12:33:13 PM] Jamie: Somehow these guys get so far!
[2020-02-11, 12:33:47 PM] Rob Feeny: And have someone at La Scala I'm going to talk to. Had a subbed job lined up with Pure Image but it fell through. Steve Dyck (formerly Imagine AV) actually tried to hire me as a project manager for them
[2020-02-11, 12:35:02 PM] Jamie: I know a guy at LaScala. Ian Burrows. Who’s your contact?
[2020-02-11, 12:36:17 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm just waiting for Daniel to fill me in on that haha. It's a friend of his, Daniel and I are doing lunch tomorrow and we'll sort it. He was a designer there. I'm making a list so I can reach out regularly.
[2020-02-11, 12:37:34 PM] Jamie: Nice. Hey you should call over to a company called Commercial Electronics. They always have trouble finding installers
[2020-02-11, 12:37:39 PM] Rob Feeny: I've been surviving off of Tim's Microsoft Store service calls (double time, 2 hr minimum) because we're there every week it seems. Sometimes it's 1 hr work for 4 hrs pay. Or sometimes 6hrs work for 12hrs pay 👍🏻
[2020-02-11, 12:38:05 PM] Jamie: Used to be a guy named Hal Clark there
[2020-02-11, 12:38:10 PM] Jamie: Nice
[2020-02-11, 12:38:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'll give them a ring. Thanks
[2020-02-11, 12:39:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Tim has been squawking for ages about how much work her has lined up but it never materializes
[2020-02-11, 12:45:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Eventually I have to get my shit together and either get a real job or start another company tho
[2020-02-11, 12:45:46 PM] Rob Feeny: It's been wearing on me. But I'm getting life sorted lately and it feels good
[2020-02-11, 12:46:44 PM] Rob Feeny: I almost have all my 2018 & 2019 bookkeeping sorted and my place is damn organized
[2020-02-11, 12:47:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Shed is organized, garden & yard prepped for spring, workshop getting close to finished and van almost ready for rental season
[2020-02-11, 12:53:05 PM] Jamie: So they say 😂
[2020-02-11, 12:53:23 PM] Jamie: I am also wondering what to do with my life these days
[2020-02-11, 12:54:09 PM] Rob Feeny: How long can you last doing what you're doing? haha
[2020-02-11, 1:04:00 PM] Jamie: A while but without surfing, this place loses a lot of its value
[2020-02-11, 1:11:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet. Does it affect your typing etc?
[2020-02-11, 1:11:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Doing any side work?
[2020-02-11, 1:12:10 PM] Rob Feeny: You should pretty up my Tiny House site and see if we can get referral sales ..
[2020-02-11, 1:12:25 PM] Rob Feeny: I can create content all day but hate the dressing it up
[2020-02-11, 1:14:55 PM] Jamie: A little. Not much
[2020-02-11, 1:15:16 PM] Jamie: Just how long I can type for. It gets sore in about 2 hrs right now
[2020-02-11, 1:15:36 PM] Jamie: Be an interesting project
[2020-02-11, 1:17:41 PM] Jamie: Let me think about it. Still spending lots of time resting and I shouldn’t push it with computer work right now.
[2020-02-11, 1:26:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure man, no pressure. It get about 130 visitors a month at the moment and I haven't touched it in like 9 months haha But i can get links to it done from others in the TH world
‎[2020-02-14, 1:54:37 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-02-14, 1:55:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice! All the climbing bits...
[2020-02-14, 1:56:01 PM] Jamie: Yup. This guy has the same injury as me and was back climbing in 5 weeks. Obviously he has physio and equipment on his side but it gives me hoe
[2020-02-14, 1:56:04 PM] Jamie: hope*
[2020-02-14, 1:59:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah at least you have time and determination on your side
[2020-02-14, 2:05:45 PM] Jamie: Yup. Watching this video helped. He takes about the mental difficulty of how it looks and how he thought he would never be able to climb again
[2020-02-17, 2:17:41 PM] Rob Feeny: How's Myles' visit going?
[2020-02-17, 2:19:24 PM] Jamie: Overall, good. We had it out about 3 nights in
[2020-02-17, 2:20:02 PM] Jamie: His flight was delayed and his bag got lost so he was pretty grumpy for the first couple days.
[2020-02-17, 2:20:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yeah you mentioned that. What did you say to him? And how did he take it?
[2020-02-17, 2:23:20 PM] Jamie: I lost it on him because he was being so cheap about buying toiletries and stuff, he just wanted to use mine. Also he wanted a couple joints to take to hang out with some friends and I said just throw me $5 towards weed. He accused me of being cheap and trying to make money off him and didn’t wanna pay, said he could buy way more on the street for $5
[2020-02-17, 2:24:58 PM] Jamie: Seems like little things but he was just being a moody little bitch and I had no patience.
[2020-02-17, 2:25:26 PM] Jamie: Afterwards he was better and then got his bag and his mood improved. Last few days has been great
[2020-02-17, 2:25:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh I'm 1000% on board with that. It's good, he needed something said to him
[2020-02-17, 2:25:57 PM] Rob Feeny: If he ever asked to stay with me again anywhere I'd be super blunt with him
[2020-02-17, 2:26:06 PM] Rob Feeny: I already have him muted in FB
[2020-02-17, 2:26:40 PM] Jamie: Yeah he has some growing up to do but there are still some parts I like.
[2020-02-17, 2:27:13 PM] Jamie: Now I just tell him, buy your own shit, I don’t want you to buy me anything or pay for anything because I don’t want you to think I owe you
[2020-02-17, 2:27:25 PM] Jamie: Gonna lose wifi for 10 min. How’s van?
[2020-02-17, 2:27:31 PM] Rob Feeny: But man, $5 towards someone getting the weed already, knowing who to get good weed from and taking the risk.. that's crazy cheap. I hope you told him to go get his own
[2020-02-17, 2:27:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Is he giving you anything for the use of your room? Or is he in the hostel?
[2020-02-17, 2:28:49 PM] Rob Feeny: It's good. Heading to the truck to work. Had a great productive day yesterday, bodywork on the car, new fog light, treated windows, planted part of my garden, sealed a leak in the van etc. Felt great. Then dinner with Dan, Janice and Sheila and boardgames with them
[2020-02-17, 2:35:07 PM] Jamie: He is paying my landlord $10 a day as agreed
[2020-02-17, 2:35:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah nice. Does your landlord insist on extra pay for extra people?
[2020-02-17, 2:35:36 PM] Jamie: I did. He got his own and then gave me some back, lol
[2020-02-17, 2:36:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah he's making 6 figures and worried about $5. It kills me.
[2020-02-17, 2:36:10 PM] Jamie: No I offered. It’s fair and by offering I set the price. He just said 👍
[2020-02-17, 2:36:44 PM] Jamie: Right? And he gets a place to stay for cheap, a tour guide and my social circle
[2020-02-17, 2:37:40 PM] Rob Feeny: He was probably surprised, no local would offer 🤣
[2020-02-17, 2:37:47 PM] Rob Feeny: We're fine paying that when we're there
[2020-02-17, 2:37:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Btw need anything brought from Canada?
[2020-02-17, 2:39:04 PM] Jamie: True. I want to get the place next year and I want some improvements so I’m keeping him happy. Hopefully I can get air conditioning and I want to install an oven and a TV
[2020-02-17, 2:41:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, ok makes sense. Offer to buy in on the unit as an investment?
[2020-02-17, 2:43:42 PM] Jamie: Or buy the a/c and TV if he pays to install
[2020-02-17, 2:44:15 PM] Jamie: Maybe some face soap. I’ll know more closer to the date
[2020-02-17, 2:49:19 PM] Jamie: So Myles brought me 2 bottles of bourbon and one got smashed in transit. Happy I got one though
[2020-02-17, 3:00:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh wow that sucks. He should have put them in something hard
[2020-02-17, 3:00:36 PM] Jamie: Agreed
[2020-02-17, 3:01:32 PM] Rob Feeny: I'd bring you another but I'm doing carry-on only and flying from Lima. Although they might not have rules about that, they didn't in Mexico. I could buy a bottle of tequila in the gift shop and take it on my flight
[2020-02-17, 3:04:15 PM] Jamie: Sure. For margaritas.
[2020-02-17, 3:17:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I mean, I used to do that. I was thinking a bottle of Bourbon, I'm sure Lima has a better selection
[2020-02-18, 11:35:59 AM] Jamie: Can you send me the code?
[2020-02-18, 11:51:16 AM] Rob Feeny: I was asleep
[2020-02-18, 11:51:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Sent it again
[2020-02-18, 11:51:48 AM] Rob Feeny: 160920
[2020-02-18, 11:53:15 AM] Jamie: Sent again
[2020-02-18, 11:53:21 AM] Jamie: Hope I didn’t wake you
[2020-02-18, 11:53:28 AM] Rob Feeny: 138366
[2020-02-18, 11:53:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope. I sleep with my phone on airplane
[2020-02-18, 11:53:57 AM] Jamie: I’m in. Thx
‎[2020-02-21, 11:25:21 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-02-21, 11:25:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Figured you'd appreciate this... When you don't have a large enough crimper, you improvise
[2020-02-21, 11:26:18 AM] Rob Feeny: I think that ring terminal came from your stock too
[2020-02-21, 11:37:52 AM] Jamie: Haha beauty. I would have just used my teeth. 😬
[2020-02-21, 11:40:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha using my linesman's with all my strength still wasn't enough. But your chompers are pretty beefy... All that teeth grinding from years of putting up with rich people
[2020-02-21, 11:41:03 AM] Jamie: Lol exactly
[2020-02-21, 11:41:13 AM] Rob Feeny: And Morgan....
[2020-02-21, 11:58:27 AM] Jamie: And Myles
[2020-02-21, 11:59:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha definitely
[2020-02-21, 11:59:12 AM] Rob Feeny: He's still around?
[2020-02-21, 11:59:23 AM] Jamie: Nah he left a couple days ago
[2020-02-25, 10:59:33 PM] Jamie: Morgan paid you totally?
[2020-02-25, 11:10:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, felt great. Sent him a thank you
[2020-02-25, 11:11:15 PM] Rob Feeny: Even sleazy Rob paid me, minus the interest he owes
[2020-02-25, 11:24:54 PM] Jamie: Nice. How much did rob owe you
[2020-02-25, 11:24:56 PM] Jamie: ?
[2020-02-25, 11:25:30 PM] Jamie: He is really micromanaging me on this job to save money. I think he needs it bad
[2020-02-25, 11:28:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Rob was only 2k. But it was from early Dec
[2020-02-25, 11:28:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. Yah he's been hurting for a long while. His costs are way too high.
[2020-02-25, 11:28:45 PM] Jamie: Still. That means you got 5k all at once. Bet that helps
[2020-02-25, 11:29:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Hell yeah. Paid my cards down quite a bit and refilled the tax account I've been stealing from
[2020-02-25, 11:29:21 PM] Rob Feeny: And it's all gone now haha
[2020-02-25, 11:29:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Although I dropped 300 on groceries yesterday
[2020-02-25, 11:30:40 PM] Jamie: Good to hear Rob. My shoulder is 85-90% operational, I can seim and will try to surf small waves tomorrow.
[2020-02-25, 11:31:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome to hear. No pain?
[2020-02-26, 12:39:22 PM] Jamie: Haha went to bed right after this and had the worst time falling asleep. No amount of Tylenol stopped the pain. Finally at 2:30 I smoked a joint an by 3:30 was sleeping. Had to wake up at 4 to walk my friend to the bus and slept from 5-8
[2020-02-26, 12:39:44 PM] Jamie: I pushed too hard yesterday and have to take at least a day off
[2020-02-26, 12:57:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahah I'm not surprised. You've got the time, but you're probably going stir crazy

[2020-02-27, 10:13:16 AM] Jamie: Lol did it work?
[2020-02-27, 10:13:39 AM] Rob Feeny: That's the second pic..
[2020-02-27, 10:14:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Worked like a charm, I used the tie-down hook under the back bumper on my car and was very, very gentle
[2020-02-27, 10:14:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Some damn good roots in there!
[2020-02-27, 12:52:16 PM] Rob Feeny: 931346
[2020-02-27, 12:52:35 PM] Jamie: Thx
[2020-02-27, 2:41:55 PM] Rob Feeny: I've tried to put up 6 shades so far today. 5 of them have been wrong.
‎[2020-02-27, 2:42:04 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-02-27, 3:16:13 PM] Jamie: For who?
[2020-02-27, 3:16:30 PM] Jamie: For your place or for a client?
[2020-02-27, 3:16:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Not sure if you know Josh Hyde. Craftsman Low Voltage. He was brought in to sort out a disaster of a Crestron install in the British Properties
[2020-02-27, 3:17:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Asian family, tried to save money by buying wholesale via someone, rather than go through a Crestron dealer. First time around, the person took their 100k and disappeared
[2020-02-27, 3:17:59 PM] Jamie: Holy shit.
[2020-02-27, 3:18:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Second time around they again bought them through someone and then found someone to do the install, but the installer messed it very badly and got fired halfway through
[2020-02-27, 3:19:01 PM] Jamie: Shades are a tough industry. But too short? That’s crazy. Lutron adds an extra 9 inches to each one on top of your dimensions. Hard to fuck that dimension up. Width? That’s much kore difficult
[2020-02-27, 3:19:04 PM] Jamie: more*
[2020-02-27, 3:19:14 PM] Jamie: Any chance they are just mislabeled?
[2020-02-27, 3:19:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh yah they just didn't know what they were doing when then measured. Lots of them don't fit into the pocket in the ceiling and they'll be slightly different sizes for exactly the same sized Windows
[2020-02-27, 3:20:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope. We've been trying to find matches or seeing where we can reuse some of the wrong ones but it's not going well
[2020-02-27, 3:21:11 PM] Rob Feeny: They've had no window coverings for almost a year
[2020-02-27, 3:21:26 PM] Rob Feeny: In a massive 5 level house at the top of the British Properties
[2020-02-27, 3:21:47 PM] Rob Feeny: With scaffolding inside the whole time and paper on the windows in
[2020-02-27, 3:24:19 PM] Jamie: Jesus. I’m sure you don’t want to take on the problem but I know a guy that can cut them down in width
[2020-02-27, 3:25:17 PM] Jamie: I hate hearing stuff like that but when you try to go cheap...
[2020-02-27, 3:32:19 PM] Rob Feeny: The Crestron ones? Sounds like quite a job..
[2020-02-27, 3:38:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Josh really knows his shit, he's doing an assessment on the whole place, but it's disheartening when you try to do a room and one out of six works!
[2020-02-27, 3:47:18 PM] Jamie: Any shades. He owns a shade better in North Van and cut down lots for me
[2020-02-29, 3:14:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Josh knew him, I think a few will go to him (larger, expensive ones) but the smaller ones aren't worth it (and he's had a few bad experiences there)
[2020-02-29, 3:14:59 PM] Rob Feeny: We have put three full days in. 3 guys working and we're maybe 30% done. But $50 an hour and I'm learning now stuff so it's great.
[2020-02-29, 3:58:40 PM] Jamie: Sweet!
[2020-02-29, 4:32:33 PM] Jamie: Yeah he was about 90% for me. I told the clients exactly that but he’s the only guy willing to try
[2020-02-29, 4:34:02 PM] Jamie: So my tenants (who have been evacuated since Nov 10) finally gave unofficial notice.
[2020-03-02, 11:04:56 AM] Rob Feeny: That's shitty. Does your insurance cover any of the costs of not being able to use it/rent it?
[2020-03-02, 11:07:41 AM] Rob Feeny: So Vancouver is freaking out about COVID19. I went to Superstore to do a big shop, since Morgan and Rob both paid me out. It was carnage. Dry goods like beans & rice were cleaned out, as were flour, canned goods, anything for sterilizing etc.
‎[2020-03-02, 11:07:46 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-03-02, 11:07:49 AM] Rob Feeny: The rice section
[2020-03-02, 11:07:55 AM] Jamie: Wow!!
[2020-03-02, 11:08:26 AM] Jamie: Yes. $1000 deductible.
[2020-03-02, 11:09:05 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm part of it. After reading a sobering article about international logistics, illness and our interlinked economy, I spent $300 stocking up on stuff. I'm not super worried about the virus but I am worried about our economy
[2020-03-03, 11:18:02 AM] Jamie: Rob I have to warn you, I might fly home early. It’s not confirmed yet but my shoulder is not healing and I am having no luck finding doctors or physio people here to help me.
[2020-03-03, 11:19:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh crap man, that really sucks and I'm sorry it hear it
[2020-03-03, 11:20:54 AM] Rob Feeny: I understand tho. There's also a chance we won't be able to go, due to the virus fears (people are freaking out here). It's 3 weeks away and they're still talking about travel restrictions. Sheila is mostly worried about not getting back to Canada as she needs to write her nursing exam after she gets back
[2020-03-03, 11:21:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Will your place be up for rent? Haha
[2020-03-03, 11:21:53 AM] Jamie: Yeah totally. I would keep it I think, because I want it for next year and the landlord has been good to me. So I would move a friend in for the extra month
[2020-03-03, 11:22:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok, good to know. I'm curious what happens if they start cancelling flights. Whether we'd get a refund etc.
[2020-03-03, 11:22:36 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll send you an interesting, sobering article about COVID19
[2020-03-03, 11:22:57 AM] Rob Feeny: https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6
[2020-03-03, 11:23:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Btw I billed for 20hrs yesterday. Will do the same again today. Whee.
[2020-03-03, 11:26:31 AM] Jamie: Do you think I should call my travel insurance people and let them know about the injury?
[2020-03-03, 11:45:22 AM] Rob Feeny: I think so. I'd read the terms first to see what would apply. It might be urgent care things only but you don't know until you read it
[2020-03-03, 11:45:40 AM] Rob Feeny: They might also have some thing about informing them within a time frame
[2020-03-03, 1:47:02 PM] Rob Feeny: This mess of a house makes a lot more sense now. The homeowner decided to be the General for his build and save the money
[2020-03-03, 4:11:43 PM] Jamie: Yeah that never works
[2020-03-03, 4:15:59 PM] Rob Feeny: And I just learned the house was "built" in 2016. They've had paper covering their windows since the.
[2020-03-03, 4:16:28 PM] Rob Feeny: But hey, money for me and I'm learning lots. The Crestron system works pretty well
[2020-03-05, 12:30:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Any word on insurance? What would they cover? Flight changes and rent prepaid?
[2020-03-05, 12:36:08 PM] Jamie: I don’t think anything unless it is emergency. I read the fine print and that’s my understanding
[2020-03-05, 1:24:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, really, your costs aren't that high are they? $200 to change the flight?
[2020-03-05, 1:37:10 PM] Jamie: Something like that. I’ve got an appointment next week with an orthopaedic surgeon in one of the bigger cities here. Hopefully new xrays and maybe an MRI before I decide
[2020-03-05, 1:37:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Hope it goes well.
[2020-03-05, 1:54:56 PM] Jamie: Thanks
[2020-03-11, 9:06:27 AM] Rob Feeny: How are you down south?
[2020-03-11, 9:09:09 AM] Jamie: Not bad. I go to Cuenca today to see a doctor about my shoulder. Not looking forward to the 7 hours on a bus. At least it’s 3hrs then 4hrs so I get a break in the middle.
[2020-03-11, 9:09:23 AM] Jamie: How are you guys doing? Stockpiling toilet paper?
[2020-03-11, 9:09:58 AM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. But good that you'll get it looked at.
[2020-03-11, 9:10:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Heck yah. Haha I stockpiled before this all started, but I might grab an extra. Mostly in case I need to spend a month home sick
[2020-03-11, 9:11:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Sheila is super stressing because she works in a hospital
[2020-03-11, 9:12:48 AM] Rob Feeny: But she's also stressing that she might not be able to come back to Canada after Ecuador to finish her practicum (due to quarantines, closed borders or bankrupt airlines)
[2020-03-11, 9:13:12 AM] Rob Feeny: I told her to wait a week and see what happens, the airlines have all waived the flight change fees for now
[2020-03-11, 10:50:15 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm still planning on it, I can make the call as late as I like, changes are free
[2020-03-11, 10:50:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Honestly my worry is that airlines are going to run out of cash. United bookings are down 70% and they're flying empty planes around
[2020-03-11, 6:03:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Well Sheila is 95% sure she's not traveling
[2020-03-11, 8:09:12 PM] Jamie: That sucks but I understand
[2020-03-11, 8:09:39 PM] Jamie: Yikes. I hope I can get home
[2020-03-12, 3:13:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Might want to start looking at it.
[2020-03-12, 3:13:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Quebec is quarantining anyone entering from outside the country for 14 days
[2020-03-12, 3:13:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Or just decide you're going to wait it out down there
[2020-03-12, 3:14:02 PM] Jamie: In a paid for hotel?!?
[2020-03-12, 3:14:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Who knows? And if they enter from other provinces? Didn't get the details, it was an update through Sheila
[2020-03-12, 3:19:59 PM] Jamie: Interesting. Anything on the government of Canada website?
[2020-03-12, 3:20:56 PM] Jamie: Once I see the doctor here, it’s posible I will be coming home to get in line for surgery. Early news is that I need to take some ligament from my leg or arm and use it to lengthen the snapped ones in my shoulder.

[2020-03-12, 4:56:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Have you booked your flight yet?
[2020-03-12, 4:57:54 PM] Jamie: No. I can’t get through to the RBC rewards people. No answer at the 1800 number through Skype. But Skype seems to be having issues
[2020-03-12, 4:58:09 PM] Jamie: I’m going to try to reschedule my original ticket.
[2020-03-12, 5:22:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, if you need me to call then ghetto 3way you in with Skype, let me know
[2020-03-12, 5:23:18 PM] Jamie: Thanks. They have a notice on their website saying they are flooded with calls. Tomorrow morning I will try again
‎[2020-03-12, 6:36:26 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-03-12, 6:37:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow. Ouch. You really hurt yourself, man
[2020-03-12, 6:38:39 PM] Jamie: Seems like. I can’t tell, to me the X-ray looks like uneven positioning and badly done but they were super professional and did it several times to make sure they were happy with it
[2020-03-12, 6:49:32 PM] Rob Feeny: So Josh just said the Canadian Health Minister has asked any Canadians returning from abroad to self quarantine for 2 weeks...
[2020-03-12, 6:49:37 PM] Rob Feeny: I haven't googled it yet
[2020-03-12, 6:52:17 PM] Jamie: Yeah I read that, I think. I read it as self monitor for 14 days not self quarantine for 14 days.
[2020-03-12, 6:58:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll have to do some research.
[2020-03-12, 6:58:20 PM] Rob Feeny: But if you spot a link ..
[2020-03-12, 7:00:03 PM] Jamie: Ok will do. Once I change my ticket, I will research more. The worst part about my shoulder? I’m finally getting regular sex and it fucking hurts! Like the rug burn on your knees you don’t feel until later...
[2020-03-12, 7:15:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahahaha. That's kind of hilarious... But yay for you
[2020-03-12, 7:16:07 PM] Jamie: Yeah I’m in Cuenca at her house this weekend while I see the doctors. Kinda nice...
[2020-03-12, 7:16:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha how's the local flavor?
[2020-03-12, 7:20:08 PM] Jamie: She’s from Venezuela and she is a total sweetheart. And I find her really sexy so that helps... and she is very into me
[2020-03-12, 7:32:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome, I'm stoked. Any long-term potential?
[2020-03-12, 8:05:01 PM] Jamie: Not sure.
[2020-03-13, 8:35:43 AM] Jamie: Still no answer at RBC Rewards. Doesn’t even pick up
[2020-03-13, 9:24:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I think everyone is getting crushed at the moment
[2020-03-13, 9:29:04 AM] Jamie: I wonder if the airports are super busy with people coming home?
[2020-03-13, 9:31:11 AM] Jamie: I would have to try to get to Kelowna. You saw the email from PopaRide? Doesn’t look like this is an option unless I self quarantine first. But where do I do that in Vancouver? So maybe I have to just buy a ticket to Kelowna directly. Stay in the lower half of dads house
[2020-03-13, 9:31:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm no I haven't gotten anything from them, actually
[2020-03-13, 9:32:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Maybe head to the cabin?
[2020-03-13, 9:42:18 AM] Rob Feeny: I think it's more people that haven't travelled yet cancelling their plans
[2020-03-13, 9:49:26 AM] Jamie: Hope so
[2020-03-13, 1:26:47 PM] Jamie: Hey wanna do some cash work for Brent removing his hot tub wiring?
[2020-03-13, 1:27:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Surr
[2020-03-13, 1:27:17 PM] Jamie: Perfect. Wanna send him a message?
[2020-03-13, 1:27:18 PM] Rob Feeny: *sure. I'm busy today but free tonight and tomorrow afternoon
[2020-03-13, 1:27:23 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll message him on fb
[2020-03-13, 1:29:51 PM] Jamie: He may want you to hook it up too 👍
[2020-03-13, 1:33:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Perf
[2020-03-13, 2:37:20 PM] Jamie: Hey do you think you can try a number for me? Skype says no answer but usually I hear a ringing sound of it is actually ringing and I haven’t
[2020-03-13, 2:37:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure
[2020-03-13, 2:37:59 PM] Jamie: 18776362870
[2020-03-13, 2:38:17 PM] Jamie: Just need to know what’s happening on the other end
[2020-03-13, 2:38:53 PM] Rob Feeny: The call just fails. I tried 3x
[2020-03-13, 2:39:17 PM] Jamie: Ok at least I know that and can try in the middle of the night.
[2020-03-13, 2:39:26 PM] Jamie: Might have to just buy a ticket
[2020-03-13, 2:39:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch man, I'm sorry
[2020-03-13, 2:41:04 PM] Jamie: Not a big deal. Overstaying in Ecuador would cost me $800 anyway
[2020-03-13, 2:42:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh true.
[2020-03-13, 2:42:46 PM] Rob Feeny: Lots of shit going on right now
[2020-03-13, 2:43:05 PM] Jamie: No kidding. You know my condo flooded right?
[2020-03-13, 2:43:19 PM] Jamie: In November?
[2020-03-13, 2:43:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. And your renters are leaving :(
[2020-03-13, 2:43:56 PM] Jamie: Yeah they are out now.
[2020-03-13, 2:44:32 PM] Jamie: I can imagine how many people are going to be moving into new condos while this virus situation is happening, lol.
[2020-03-13, 2:45:28 PM] Jamie: So probably may 1, I have to try to rent it or pay the total cost myself until I can get people in
[2020-03-13, 2:46:31 PM] Jamie: At this point, with my shoulder, the condo and the virus, I couldn’t care less about anything. I’m just going to eat all the deserts and crappy food I’ve wanted and have as much one armed sex as possible until the world explodes 😂😂😂
[2020-03-13, 3:04:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe you should just fly to Calgary and isolate in there
[2020-03-13, 3:06:37 PM] Jamie: Haha unfortunately cant move it until end of April
[2020-03-13, 3:09:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn. Ok, I have a tent for you.
[2020-03-13, 3:12:26 PM] Jamie: Haha
[2020-03-13, 3:12:29 PM] Jamie: https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-self-isolate-home-1.5493910
[2020-03-13, 3:13:16 PM] Jamie: Dad says I can stay at his place. Separate bathroom etc and all wording has been for people with symptoms or from places with travel bans
[2020-03-13, 5:26:40 PM] Jamie: https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories
[2020-03-14, 6:36:30 PM] Jamie: Rob what’s the situation like there? I may be able to get a ticket but I’m worried that I am flying into a bigger problem there than here. What do you think?
[2020-03-14, 6:40:46 PM] Rob Feeny: I think it's safe here. It's just a lot of freaking out and stress. Really what we're trying to do is flatten the curve. The hospitals are busy with testing etc, but after seeing what happened in Italy and China, the isolation is to slow the spread. We can't stop it, 40-70% will get it (they say that holds true for the world). You and I are young and healthy, we're isolating so people like Stoja and Stipe can have the beds
[2020-03-14, 6:41:03 PM] Rob Feeny: I was actually there fixing their shed but I wouldn't go inside because I might be a carrier
[2020-03-14, 6:41:46 PM] Jamie: Do you think the airlines and busses I will have to take to get home increase my risk over just staying here?
[2020-03-14, 6:42:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I think they increase your risk of getting it sooner... The thing is, this might drag on quite a while
[2020-03-14, 6:43:25 PM] Jamie: Yeah I can stay here indefinitely and only pay $900 USD for overstaying my visa, when I leave.
[2020-03-14, 6:43:35 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm really not sure what I'd do in your situation, to be honest.
[2020-03-14, 6:44:34 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a tough one. The hope is that it's nothing crazy but there's a chance it might get that way. Although I hear it is less able to spread in warmer climates
[2020-03-14, 6:45:30 PM] Jamie: I’m actually quite scared about the speed I would have to operate in order to get home. I can get a flight Thursday that skips the US and goes directly from Mexico to Vancouver through Panama.
[2020-03-14, 6:46:06 PM] Jamie: But it’s 10 hrs of bus rides in 2 days and then 2 days of airports and airplanes. Fuuuuuuuck
[2020-03-14, 7:04:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch. Lots of exposure
[2020-03-14, 7:05:51 PM] Jamie: Yeah for what it’s worth, I just got some hand sanitizer that apparently is 90% alcohol so that will help no matter what. And I’m thinking about buying mittens so I don’t touch my face, lol
[2020-03-14, 7:11:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah that's a tough one for me too haha
[2020-03-14, 7:30:42 PM] Jamie: I can’t make this decision right now. I will decide tomorrow.
[2020-03-14, 7:32:53 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll help however I can man but I'm kind of unsure just like you
[2020-03-15, 11:00:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Did you see any official statement online from the Ecuadorian Government? Sheila needs documentation to apply for refund for her flight rather than a credir
‎[2020-03-15, 11:04:00 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-03-15, 11:05:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Thanks. and oh shit. But really, it's a pretty isolated place to be. And I bet you could apply for a waiver on the 900 fee as you simply can't get home
[2020-03-15, 11:05:41 AM] Rob Feeny: and remember that if it gets really bad, the Canadian Government will get you home. Are you registed in the database of Citizens Abroad?
[2020-03-15, 11:11:27 AM] Jamie: Yes I am. I got their emails.
[2020-03-15, 11:14:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Beauty. In any major crisis they provide evacuations
[2020-03-15, 11:15:21 AM] Jamie: Fuck I have a flight but my credit card is in olon and I don’t have a picture of the security code
[2020-03-15, 11:17:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Use mine
[2020-03-15, 11:18:05 AM] Jamie: I think I found it
[2020-03-15, 11:18:26 AM] Rob Feeny: how much?
[2020-03-15, 11:18:28 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll check what I have available
[2020-03-15, 11:18:36 AM] Jamie: I got mine
[2020-03-15, 11:18:46 AM] Rob Feeny: ok cool
[2020-03-15, 11:48:47 AM] Rob Feeny: I just sent Rob Autar an invoice for $1.67 🤣
[2020-03-15, 11:48:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Interest on the interest he never paid
[2020-03-15, 11:54:11 AM] Jamie: Awesome!
[2020-03-15, 11:56:45 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll just let it build for a few years then sell it to a bill collector
[2020-03-15, 9:13:15 PM] Jamie: I’m getting very nervous. On Tuesday at 6am they are banning unnecessary travel within the country. I might not even be able to get back to Olón
[2020-03-15, 9:34:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Isn't your travel necessary?
[2020-03-15, 9:34:41 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm sure if it comes down to it, you can pay a taxi $100 to take you
[2020-03-15, 9:44:15 PM] Jamie: I’m sure many people think the same thing. But I think I have a private taxi to take me to the airport if I can get to Olón on Tuesday.
[2020-03-15, 10:07:48 PM] Jamie: Just heard (unconfirmed) that the main bus depot in Guayaquil will close Tuesday morning. Also that airport will close completely tomorrow. I wish the would just announce it directly on the news instead of only alluding to it. At least then I know I’m stuck.
[2020-03-15, 10:13:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. I hear the president is basically a trump.
[2020-03-16, 12:16:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, I'm glad you at least have a safe, comfortable place to wait out the craziness
[2020-03-16, 12:16:37 PM] Rob Feeny: It sucks that you can't come home but everything will work out in the end..
[2020-03-16, 12:22:34 PM] Jamie: Totally. And my Spanish will be way better. Dani speaks barely any English.
[2020-03-16, 12:25:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahahaha lots of Google translate? Yep, should help a lot...
[2020-03-16, 12:28:32 PM] Jamie: Yeah I can say most day to day things but if we really have to talk about something, google translate works great
[2020-03-16, 12:29:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha trial by fire. Eventually you'll be debating politics
[2020-03-17, 10:15:46 AM] Jamie: How’s your finances? Be ok to not work for a month or two? I heard about a $150 a day relief fund in Canada?
[2020-03-17, 10:16:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Oh really? I haven't heard about that but would welcome it. I've got about 5k in accounts receivables that should be coming in shortly, plus 10k in my tax account that I could technically steal from.
[2020-03-17, 10:17:12 AM] Rob Feeny: I dumped a bit too much into my Armageddon prep
[2020-03-17, 10:17:22 AM] Rob Feeny: But have supplies for about 2yrs haha
[2020-03-17, 10:23:55 AM] Jamie: If I see the link again I will send it. I thought of you right away.
[2020-03-17, 10:24:07 AM] Jamie: Let me know if you need money.
[2020-03-17, 10:24:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man. I'm actually pretty well sorted out, just did a ton of work for people that actually pay. Plus I'm sitting on 1k in cash and 2k in gold
[2020-03-17, 10:24:50 AM] Rob Feeny: Appreciated
[2020-03-17, 10:25:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Sadly Sheila isn't working, she actually pays to do her practicum
[2020-03-17, 10:25:27 AM] Rob Feeny: But in Italy, the skipped finals and graduated all the nursing/doctoral students early so...
[2020-03-17, 10:42:07 AM] Jamie: Can you freeze cooked rice? I’m trying to stock up on food that doesn’t need to be cooked in case gas deliveries stop. I heard them loading them into the building today and thought about I
[2020-03-17, 10:42:11 AM] Jamie: it*
[2020-03-17, 11:24:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm that's a good question... I think you can dry it (parboiled rice) but I'm not sure...
‎[2020-03-17, 11:44:03 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-03-17, 11:52:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Smart thinking. I guess you will have to think asian when it comes to cooking. Quick cooking things. Soaking is a good idea. Knowing your skills I bet you could build a solar cooker with tin foil...
[2020-03-17, 11:53:33 AM] Rob Feeny: They work remarkably well! For toasting tortillas haha
[2020-03-17, 11:53:35 AM] Jamie: Haha I was thinking about that. Probably attract all the neighbourhood cats and dogs to the patio
[2020-03-17, 11:53:54 AM] Rob Feeny: But if you DO run out of gas, it'd heat water well...
[2020-03-17, 11:54:10 AM] Rob Feeny: Or use it to preheat water if you're running low
[2020-03-17, 11:54:42 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm sure ecuador grows more of their food locally than we do, you should be fine
[2020-03-17, 11:55:05 AM] Jamie: We don’t control the gas. There is a central spot in the apartment building with multiple tanks locked up. No doubt if the manager runs out, he will take someone else’s.
[2020-03-17, 11:55:23 AM] Jamie: So rationing probably won’t work on our favor
[2020-03-17, 11:56:45 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhhh that sucks
[2020-03-17, 11:57:08 AM] Jamie: Totally. It’s the delivery into the city I worry about. Supply chain, right? All dependant on gas/diesel getting trucked in.
[2020-03-17, 11:57:14 AM] Rob Feeny: You can probably get a backup tank... In El Salvador they'd deliver a small one to your place for $5
[2020-03-17, 11:57:49 AM] Jamie: I’m prepared for it. We have good, drinkable tap water here too.
[2020-03-17, 11:58:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep here too. I have backup propane, camp fuel and gasoline. Scored big at the disposal depot sunday actually. Was dropping off a damaged gas can, there were 2 brand new, big, full gas cans in the disposal bin and the guy let me take the for free!
[2020-03-17, 11:58:12 AM] Jamie: We have lots of tuna, beans and rice
[2020-03-17, 11:58:12 AM] Rob Feeny: $80 value...
[2020-03-17, 11:58:19 AM] Jamie: Nice!
[2020-03-17, 11:58:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Perfect
[2020-03-17, 11:58:52 AM] Rob Feeny: I also have solar panels and batteries, for the workshop but... hahah but there's only a .00001% chance we'll come to needing that
[2020-03-17, 12:00:41 PM] Jamie: The worst part is I have been fighting a head cold for a few days. I can feel it but with all the homemade lemonada I have been drinking, it’s not totally here. No fever, no shortness of breath, no coughing, no runny nose, just sinus pressure. But what an active mind can do with that, right??
[2020-03-17, 12:01:23 PM] Jamie: I always thought that if the end of the world came, I would have my health and strong body. Facing all of this with one arm never factored in
[2020-03-17, 12:05:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I get it. But at least your mind is working well.
[2020-03-17, 12:06:02 PM] Rob Feeny: And you're more functional with one arm than most with 2
[2020-03-17, 12:06:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yeah but your risk is very low for the infection, it won't kill you. Just older or sicker or fatter people
[2020-03-17, 5:54:55 PM] Jamie: Hey man. Having trouble getting contact information for the Canadian Embassy here with super slow internet. If you have time, can you help me out?
[2020-03-17, 5:58:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Sure

[2020-03-17, 6:02:45 PM] Rob Feeny: @canadaecuador on twitter
[2020-03-17, 6:47:15 PM] Jamie: Thanks. I still don’t think I can get to the airport because all travel is shut down but hey if they send a Lear jet, I’m in!
[2020-03-17, 6:48:02 PM] Jamie: Also found out that insurance companies are cancelling travel policies 10 days after the Canadian government said come home. So I would be here without insurance
[2020-03-17, 6:54:28 PM] Rob Feeny: I would contact them ASAP and say you can't get out. Tell them they can cancel it if they help you find a way home!
[2020-03-17, 6:55:03 PM] Rob Feeny: The Canadian Government has definitely sent airliners to other countries to get citizens before but probably not to Cuenca

[2020-03-17, 8:58:31 PM] Jamie: Empanadas. Carne y jamón y queso.
[2020-03-17, 9:02:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Que rico. Tengo celos
[2020-03-17, 9:02:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Good?
[2020-03-17, 9:03:14 PM] Jamie: Si, pero voy a estar gordo
[2020-03-17, 9:19:27 PM] Jamie: Well my flight that I had booked for Thursday just got cancelled. I couldn’t get to it anyway but now I have ammunition for a refund or credit.
[2020-03-17, 9:26:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Ya eres el hermano gordo
[2020-03-17, 9:26:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Well crap. I hope you can get ahold of the embassy for some help. You're being foiled at every turn
[2020-03-17, 9:26:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Or ammunition for continuation of your medical insurance
‎[2020-03-17, 9:28:18 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-03-17, 9:29:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow
[2020-03-17, 9:34:40 PM] Jamie: You can use this, I don’t mind
[2020-03-18, 5:03:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Anything from the embassy? The whole cancelled life insurance thing is kinda shitty
[2020-03-18, 7:20:22 PM] Jamie: Actually called the insurance company. I am actually covered for the virus and they will extend on case by case basis if I can’t get out of the country. Very helpful people actually
[2020-03-18, 7:20:32 PM] Jamie: Embassy has given shit
[2020-03-18, 7:21:02 PM] Rob Feeny: That's awesome, glad to hear it
[2020-03-18, 7:23:53 PM] Jamie: What are you doing right now?

[2020-03-18, 7:26:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Specifically? Or generally?
[2020-03-18, 7:27:17 PM] Jamie: Specifically
[2020-03-18, 7:27:56 PM] Jamie: Aww that’s so nice! You made me a quarantine area! ❤️
[2020-03-18, 7:29:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha sure, it's all yours
[2020-03-18, 7:29:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Been puttering a lot
[2020-03-18, 7:45:39 PM] Jamie: I bet. Shelia staying with you?
[2020-03-18, 7:48:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes. She's on hold for the next week then returning to her practicum

[2020-03-18, 7:48:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Keeping busy
[2020-03-18, 7:49:26 PM] Jamie: That’s great man. Wish I had a place to fix up, but I am making improvements on Dani’s place
[2020-03-18, 7:49:54 PM] Jamie: Happy to hear that. Sucks to be alone during this
[2020-03-18, 7:54:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Totally. Christian is leaving tonight for Thailand to stay with his dad... (!?)
[2020-03-18, 7:55:01 PM] Rob Feeny: It's in our blood 🤣
[2020-03-18, 7:55:26 PM] Jamie: What the fuck? Seriously? Is he stupid? Through this mess to a place with maybe worse healthcare?
[2020-03-18, 7:56:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. His dad is wealthy and lives there.. he was supposed to go for 2 months
[2020-03-18, 7:58:25 PM] Jamie: Shit. If his flight doesn’t go out, don’t let him back in.
[2020-03-18, 7:59:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah thanks I hadn't thought of that...
‎[2020-03-20, 10:11:04 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted

[2020-03-20, 10:11:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Brongbon the gordovirus
[2020-03-20, 10:11:23 AM] Rob Feeny: *bring on
[2020-03-20, 10:11:47 AM] Jamie: Haha yeah that is happening here too. Dessert is the highlight of the entire day.
[2020-03-20, 10:15:18 AM] Rob Feeny: We started with dessert
[2020-03-20, 10:15:41 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm still getting a bit of work at least. Prewire jobs are pretty solitary
[2020-03-20, 10:16:19 AM] Jamie: Good point. Get the wholesaler to deliver!
[2020-03-20, 10:17:39 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep. Going to work with Morgan next week. Told him he's got to pay right away haha
[2020-03-21, 11:03:26 AM] Rob Feeny: tech qustion..  I'm trying to size an inverter (and battery cables) large enough to run your Makita mitre saw. The makita site lists it as a 15a 120V saw, but I know they tend to pull higher amps as a startup surge. Any idea how high that could be>
[2020-03-21, 11:03:26 AM] Rob Feeny: ?
[2020-03-21, 11:33:42 AM] Jamie: Hmmm not really. This would be a very interesting calculation I bet. I remember reading about calculating pumps and compressors for solar because of the startup. Maybe start there?
‎[2020-03-21, 12:13:29 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-03-21, 12:14:29 PM] Rob Feeny: You've got loads of sun there...
[2020-03-21, 12:14:49 PM] Rob Feeny: But coating it in citrus juice before drying it in the sun will keep it from going brown
[2020-03-21, 12:15:55 PM] Jamie: Good to know. Just drip or soak them?
[2020-03-21, 12:16:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Just toss them in it. An even quick coating
[2020-03-21, 12:19:18 PM] Jamie: Nice. Done.

[2020-03-21, 1:14:30 PM] Jamie: Hash browns! Breakfast at 1:30pm!
[2020-03-21, 1:17:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha fatty
[2020-03-21, 1:17:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Teaching her Canadian food?
[2020-03-21, 1:20:29 PM] Jamie: Yup. And she is teaching me Latina food

[2020-03-21, 4:48:42 PM] Jamie: Looks cozy!
[2020-03-21, 4:48:57 PM] Jamie: Can I control the light on my phone?
[2020-03-21, 4:50:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha it's got a pull string...
[2020-03-21, 4:57:21 PM] Jamie: Perfect. I will tie it around my phone. Not it’s controlled by my phone 😂
[2020-03-21, 4:57:29 PM] Jamie: Now*

[2020-03-21, 10:29:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh shit, guess there's no room for you now 🤣
[2020-03-22, 12:02:22 PM] Jamie: Hey Rob - to talk seriously about my hopeful return to Canada. I may be able to fly into Vancouver but maybe Toronto. I am trying to manage the logistics of staying and also returning to Canada. The best plan is that I get to Vancouver but Dave has offered one of his camp houses if I need it and their RV which is parked there. The issue is I have no way to get to Kelowna. I’m hoping for someone to poke holes in my planning I guess. Is it an option to stay in your van? Can we get water hooked up to it at the house and can I drive it to a dump station? Is this feasible ?
[2020-03-22, 12:03:12 PM] Jamie: Or maybe I drive it to Kelowna because Dave’s camp has plumbing and a kitchen?
[2020-03-22, 12:13:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes, definitely an option. There's a sani-dump at the Husky at Willingdon that costs $5. And the water hose reaches. I don't have any rentals for the next while (it's registered as an RV available for rental for quarantine but no bites yet). It's a comfy spot to be stuck for a couple of weeks, especially since it's mobile
[2020-03-22, 12:18:52 PM] Jamie: Ok appreciate the option. It’s very logistically difficult to get out of here. I need permission from the government (which the Canadian embassy seems to be getting if you can prove flight details) but I would have to hire a taxi for an 8 hour ride, maybe $400USD.  Then I am in Quito with no support if the flight gets cancelled.
[2020-03-22, 12:19:17 PM] Jamie: But I will keep working both options. Frankly because I have nothing else to do, lol
[2020-03-22, 12:23:07 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet. You just get to sit there and go stir crazy with worry
[2020-03-22, 12:25:04 PM] Jamie: You should see the WhatsApp group for Canadians stuck in Ecuador. 200 people (I think that is the max?) just freaking out and trying to charter jets and spreading rumours. It’s nuts. I muted it and just scroll back every once in awhile.
‎[2020-03-22, 12:39:22 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-03-22, 12:44:58 PM] Rob Feeny: haha, and?
[2020-03-22, 12:45:10 PM] Jamie: They... rusted?
[2020-03-22, 12:45:35 PM] Rob Feeny: reacted, it's a strong oxidizer. You only need like a 5% solution for disinfection
[2020-03-22, 12:45:47 PM] Rob Feeny: But rusting is oxidation..
[2020-03-22, 12:49:36 PM] Jamie: Yeah I went 50 / 50 and just about burnt the shit up haha
[2020-03-22, 4:06:18 PM] Jamie: Haha life is going crazy. We are having a dozen condoms delivered from the farmacia. Totally making her answer the door
[2020-03-22, 7:56:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha only a dozen?
[2020-03-22, 7:56:12 PM] Rob Feeny: That's only 5 days!
[2020-03-23, 2:02:56 PM] Jamie: Pretty heavy but ... wow

[2020-03-23, 5:27:13 PM] Jamie: I think Dani has given up trying to speak simply to me. I can’t understand what she is saying and the moment I ask her to repeat but slowly with simple words she picks up the phone. The shitty part is I am getting in the habit of just tuning out because I can’t even begin to comprehend.
[2020-03-23, 5:28:03 PM] Jamie: I feel bad because I know she is probably scared but I can’t help but be annoyed. It’s all on me to communicate in her language
[2020-03-23, 5:33:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh damn man. That's tough. I completely understand the frustration. So you communicate through Google translate?
[2020-03-23, 5:57:09 PM] Jamie: Normally we keep it simple and I can understand her or ask her to slow down. She has a very strong accent too. But... she seems to be getting frustrated with the fact that I straight up say no entiendo if she speaks to fast and too much.
[2020-03-23, 5:57:42 PM] Jamie: My brain is also tired from constantly having to do all the work to communicate in her language.
[2020-03-23, 6:32:30 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm sure you're both getting tired and cranky and frustrated and you're trapped in a small space. It sucks
[2020-03-23, 6:38:27 PM] Rob Feeny: Has she ever left the country? If not she has no idea what it's like to be in your situation
[2020-03-23, 7:01:24 PM] Jamie: This, a little for sure. We are doing great considering. I’m just venting.
[2020-03-23, 7:01:45 PM] Jamie: She’s from Venezuela so yes but not a different language country
[2020-03-23, 7:11:11 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah you need to go to a country that doesn't speak your language to actually understand...
[2020-03-24, 11:00:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Out of condoms and food yet? 🤣
[2020-03-24, 11:01:31 AM] Jamie: Haha no. As for the condoms, I may have broken her so we took last night off. 😉
[2020-03-24, 11:01:38 AM] Jamie: And we have boatloads of food.
[2020-03-24, 11:02:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha yah for the Feeny boys
[2020-03-24, 11:02:54 AM] Jamie: Still a little weird with her right now, not sure what’s happening. She’s not very aware of her own behaviour. But I’m doing everything in my power to accept that she is scared and it probably nothing to do with me
[2020-03-24, 11:03:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Sheila is going stir crazy, her practicum is cancelled. She's mending anything made of fabric in my house and cooking all the things. There's zero room in the fridge 🤣
[2020-03-24, 11:03:12 AM] Rob Feeny: How old is she?
[2020-03-24, 11:04:36 AM] Jamie: I also think she is scared I might leave and catch a flight home. If so, life is pretty scary for her.  Alone, with no work and no pay. The house would be well stocked and I hid a months rent ($230) in a drawer in case I leave but it must be hard
[2020-03-24, 11:04:40 AM] Jamie: 28
[2020-03-24, 11:05:44 AM] Jamie: Oh boy. At least you guys have a little yard. Doing any fires?
[2020-03-24, 11:07:41 AM] Rob Feeny: Yikes. What does she do for work normally?
[2020-03-24, 11:08:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Not yet but keep talking about it. I'm still working full time and working on prepper projects, repairs etc every night. My 'to do' list is dwindling tho
[2020-03-24, 11:12:36 AM] Jamie: She works at a chocolatier. Makes the basic minimum salary of $400 plus $30 bonus. But she hasn’t worked in a week now.
[2020-03-24, 11:13:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep it's going to be damn tough for her and many others
[2020-03-24, 11:13:08 AM] Jamie: That’s pretty good. I am going to start leaning Sketch for 3D modeling. Something else I can offer online
[2020-03-24, 11:13:11 AM] Rob Feeny: How did you meet her?
[2020-03-24, 11:13:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Sweet, I can use you haha
[2020-03-24, 11:13:59 AM] Jamie: She used to live in Olón and worked at a restaurant there. On busy holidays she comes back to work and I met her there on New Years
[2020-03-24, 11:14:47 AM] Jamie: Yes. The government here is enacting things to help but they will eventually have to borrow from another country. They can’t print money like the US and Canada will do
[2020-03-24, 11:59:16 AM] Rob Feeny: It's a complicated one, printing money is almost never done, except by 3rd world countries that don't understand the repercussions (insane, runaway inflation like Venezuela and Zimbabwe) but they have very few tools left to manage the economy. We might even go into negative interest rates
[2020-03-24, 3:19:27 PM] Jamie: Got any sketchup projects on the go?
[2020-03-24, 3:51:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope not atm, but was thinking, if you're bored, want to look into Mesh Network phone apps? Basically Armageddon prep haha
[2020-03-24, 3:52:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I am doing my earthquake preparedness prep right now because it's been on my mind for a few years and now it's kind of a hot topic.
[2020-03-24, 3:52:42 PM] Rob Feeny: They have apps that use your phone's wifi to create a blanket network and pass info between phones to extend everyone's reach
[2020-03-24, 3:59:36 PM] Jamie: Interesting. I’ll check it out
[2020-03-24, 4:11:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh god it's a chore to do anything that involves Dan. I offered to supply wire and connectors and install if he pays for a camera system. So of course he needs every detail, needs it to not involve any cloud storage, needs them to be black and hidden etc. I'm going to say fuck it and just install my own couple by the shed and my door
[2020-03-24, 4:13:23 PM] Jamie: I think that’s a better idea. Dan has been profiting from our labour for years and is still a dick about it.
[2020-03-26, 10:13:14 AM] Jamie: Have you been looking into the federal relief plan? You going to apply?
[2020-03-26, 10:17:40 AM] Rob Feeny: A little bit, Sheila has more, I'm still working. And yes, I need anything they're offering as I can't get EI
[2020-03-26, 10:19:11 AM] Jamie: Ok. Once you dig into it, I’m curious if I should apply
[2020-03-26, 10:38:14 AM] Rob Feeny: All of next week is paperwork and bookwork so I'll look into it then
[2020-03-26, 10:38:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Know anywhere besides ADI for camera systems?
[2020-03-26, 10:38:32 AM] Jamie: Costco
[2020-03-26, 10:38:42 AM] Jamie: Suprisly cheap and good
[2020-03-26, 10:39:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok I'll.check them out thx
[2020-03-26, 10:41:10 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm about 3 things away from feeling prepared for anything
[2020-03-26, 10:41:22 AM] Rob Feeny: And I'm putting bars inside the shed window this weekend
[2020-03-26, 10:41:27 AM] Jamie: Haha what are the three things?
[2020-03-26, 10:41:44 AM] Jamie: Wow. Increasing the security of the place quite a bit. Why?
[2020-03-26, 10:43:34 AM] Rob Feeny: House lockdown (expecting an increase in crime), reviewing and restocking all first aid stuff, packing a bug-out bag/earthquake preparedness kit, modifying the camper for longer trips (putting in a connection to take external 20lb tanks) and buying a replica pistol (!)
[2020-03-26, 10:43:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Just being paranoid but it'll carry us forward thru whatever comes our way
[2020-03-26, 10:44:33 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm actually going to see how to run a cat6 cable to the shed this weekend for cameras/hotspot
[2020-03-26, 10:44:36 AM] Jamie: True dat. Crazy. I mean the house lockdown and aux building security is a good idea anyway
[2020-03-26, 10:45:45 AM] Jamie: Maybe a flame thrower on the Mazda ?
[2020-03-26, 10:46:27 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha there's a limit. And some things, like the camera system, I'd take with me when I left
[2020-03-26, 10:47:48 AM] Jamie: I’m definitely feeling vulnerable here. People are getting robbed in the middle of the day because no one is around. There are bands of guys just hanging out near bank machines too. Most people are good here but they are no longer on the streets
[2020-03-26, 10:47:55 AM] Rob Feeny: Honestly, I do have constant low-level anxiety about where our society is going, plus now I have someone other than me to care for, so I guess it's triggering some instincts. The replica pistol is at least something to wave around if shit gets nasty. I also have bear spray in my camping gear
[2020-03-26, 10:48:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Not cool. You almost need to organize a group from the building to go get anything
[2020-03-26, 10:49:09 AM] Jamie: Not allowed. No groups allowed out and only one person per family, based on the last number of your ID allowed out on specific days
[2020-03-26, 10:49:21 AM] Rob Feeny: I also ordered a radio that all the paragliders use, it's a very long range one that also can talk to my small work radios
[2020-03-26, 10:49:46 AM] Jamie: For your battle wagon?
[2020-03-26, 10:49:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Yikes. Better just not to go out... But if you DO go out together based in safety, is there anyone patrolling?
[2020-03-26, 10:50:30 AM] Rob Feeny: Handheld. And more for earthquake/natural preparedness. In the US the cell networks went down at times during hurricanes etc
[2020-03-26, 10:50:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Plus it's the one I'll use for flying. Just bought it sooner rather than later. Only $60
[2020-03-26, 10:51:06 AM] Rob Feeny: So now I have 5 radios 🤣 enough for the whole family
[2020-03-26, 10:52:39 AM] Jamie: Yes. Police and military in the streets. Mostly during the 4pm-7am curfew but they are there. We can get groceries delivered for really cheap and there is a little store on the corner that we can whip out to for beer and ice cream. But the working bank machine is very far away (15min walk) so that’s the one I worry about. I have about $1000 cash and am spending very little so I am good for a bit
[2020-03-26, 10:52:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Plus rechargeable batteries
[2020-03-26, 10:53:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Maybe it's worth going every once in a while for a small amount of cash
[2020-03-26, 10:53:52 AM] Rob Feeny: Or really would the landlord kick you out if you run out of cash?
[2020-03-26, 10:59:13 AM] Jamie: I’m in Cuenca at Dani’s place. So not worried about that
[2020-03-26, 10:59:35 AM] Rob Feeny: I think you should stay out of sight tho, people there think all foreigners are rich... It will make you an appealing target
[2020-03-26, 10:59:37 AM] Jamie: Yeah next Wednesday I’m allowed, so I will try. P
[2020-03-26, 10:59:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I meant her landlord
[2020-03-26, 11:00:06 AM] Jamie: Totally. Maybe even send Dani with my card but I would feel shitty if she got robbed.
[2020-03-26, 11:00:31 AM] Jamie: Rent is $230 a month so we got time. And she has her own money for a bit
[2020-03-26, 11:02:46 AM] Jamie: Canada has stared sending repatriation flights to Ecuador, the first one went yesterday. But it is from Quito (8 hrs away) to Toronto, where I will have to self isolate for 2 weeks (I hear word the government will pay for hotels and food?), then try to get to Vancouver. And that would mean abandoning my backpack in Olón. It’s a tough call
[2020-03-26, 11:03:19 AM] Jamie: If there is a flight from Quito to Vancouver or Guayaquil to Vancouver, I think I will go
[2020-03-26, 11:03:23 AM] Rob Feeny: It is...
[2020-03-26, 11:03:44 AM] Rob Feeny: What's in the backpack? And would your landlord hold onto it for you?
[2020-03-26, 11:14:27 AM] Jamie: I had a friend pack it up and move it to another friends (Canadian) permanent house. Along with my surfboard and guitar. So I can get it next year if shit goes back to normal.
[2020-03-26, 11:15:28 AM] Jamie: But it has almost everything. I only brought 1 pair of shorts, 1 pair of pants, 5 pairs of boxers, 3 shirts, my computer/charger, phone/charger and passport.
[2020-03-26, 11:17:26 AM] Jamie: So my drone, all my electronics including hard drive, connectors, etc, clothing, toiletries are still there. It’s several years of refining what I needed.
[2020-03-26, 11:17:45 AM] Jamie: Also I have my arcteryx jacket here so I’m lucky
[2020-03-26, 11:26:14 AM] Rob Feeny: Just run out and buy some new stuff... 🤣
[2020-03-27, 3:14:59 PM] Jamie: Fuck I don’t know what to do. The last repatriation flight is going out on the 31st from Quito. It will cost me about $2200 CAD to get home. Don’t care so much about the money but I. Any seem to make this decision
[2020-03-27, 3:30:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn man. Tough situation. I personally vote for coming home simply because we don't know where this is going. Super low oil prices and an upcoming recession could make things very interesting in Ecuador, in addition to COVID-19, but maybe it'll all blow over?
[2020-03-27, 3:30:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Home is safe, but involves risk getting there
[2020-03-27, 3:31:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Plus leaving Dani alone, but unless she's "the one", she'll be around when you come back and will survive
[2020-03-27, 3:35:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh btw I seem to have pissed off/offended Dan quite royally by saying I wanted to do the camera system on my own. So now I'm just trashing the idea entirely
[2020-03-27, 3:35:44 PM] Jamie: Lol. Dan somehow thinks he is the most reasonable guy in the world.
[2020-03-27, 3:37:10 PM] Rob Feeny: I was stressed at the time and my message was pretty harsh but honestly I think he needed to hear it.
[2020-03-27, 3:42:41 PM] Rob Feeny: You'd have to move pretty fast to get to Quito hey?
[2020-03-27, 3:42:47 PM] Rob Feeny: And how would Dani take it?
[2020-03-27, 3:45:21 PM] Jamie: I would have to travel Monday for 8hrs, then stay overnight somewhere. Get to the airport for 7:30am
[2020-03-27, 3:48:39 PM] Jamie: If I land in Vancouver at 10:35pm PST, what are the chances of you leaving a vehicle at the airport for me? I don’t think I am allowed to take public transit
[2020-03-27, 3:49:23 PM] Jamie: Or can you think of another plan? I hear that at least 2 taxi companies aren’t operating
[2020-03-27, 3:51:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Sheila and I could get the van there. I think it would be smart to check with Dan about whether he'd be comfortable with you doing the quarantine outside the house. Probably best to ask in the family group so he has to keep appearances up 🤣
[2020-03-27, 3:52:09 PM] Jamie: Good point. Although I think I will try to fly directly to Kelowna
[2020-03-27, 3:56:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, just keep us posted
[2020-03-27, 4:34:13 PM] Jamie: Will do. Can you think of any way insurance would cover losing my backpack because I can’t go back and get it? 🤷‍♂️ worth a try
[2020-03-27, 4:35:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, it's worth a try...
[2020-03-27, 4:36:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to hear amazing? After fighting endlessly over that useless $150 travel voucher from United, they went quiet forever then a $200 USD check arrived in the mail...
[2020-03-27, 4:36:32 PM] Jamie: I have Togo travel insurance and I am on hold with them right now (yeah right), plus the tickets were bought using my RBC Rewards points.
[2020-03-27, 4:36:49 PM] Rob Feeny: And today LatAm asked for my banking info and said they'd bank transfer me a refund for my flights
[2020-03-27, 4:37:10 PM] Jamie: Nice! That’s far better than the time limited credits.
[2020-03-27, 4:37:15 PM] Rob Feeny: You might get it back eventually, but maybe they'd pay to ship it to Canada?
[2020-03-27, 4:37:46 PM] Jamie: Good point.
[2020-03-30, 11:01:08 AM] Rob Feeny: How goes the travels?
‎[2020-03-30, 11:02:47 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-03-30, 11:03:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Checkpoint?
[2020-03-30, 11:03:14 AM] Jamie: Taking people’s temperature before letting them pass. Also they spray the vehicle with cloro
[2020-03-30, 11:03:37 AM] Jamie: About 5 checkpoints so far but my driver has it all figured
[2020-03-30, 11:03:58 AM] Rob Feeny: That's crazy. Spray every vehicle with bleach?
[2020-03-30, 11:04:05 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2020-03-30, 11:04:35 AM] Jamie: Gotta kill my data. It’s draining my battery. Later dude
[2020-03-30, 11:04:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Adios
[2020-03-30, 11:04:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Good luck
[2020-03-31, 9:21:04 AM] Jamie: The problem with social distancing with Latin Americans in a line up is that they will move into any space you leave to budge ahead. Everytime i move back 6 feet, some fucker jumps the queue haha
[2020-03-31, 9:25:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep, consideration is not a thing.
[2020-03-31, 9:25:16 AM] Rob Feeny: "No corta la fila, por favor!"
[2020-03-31, 9:25:22 AM] Rob Feeny: "da me espacio!"
[2020-03-31, 9:25:32 AM] Jamie: And probably 30 years of habit.
[2020-03-31, 9:26:34 AM] Rob Feeny: Voy a quitar tu cabeza y mear en la garganta, puta!
[2020-03-31, 9:26:43 AM] Rob Feeny: Maybe don't say that one
[2020-03-31, 9:27:17 AM] Jamie: Ah shit I just played it on speakerphone thought google translate. I think he’s mad haha
[2020-03-31, 9:27:37 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha seriously?
[2020-03-31, 9:27:48 AM] Rob Feeny: "I'm going cut off your head and piss down your throat"
[2020-03-31, 9:27:51 AM] Rob Feeny: I was joking
[2020-03-31, 9:27:55 AM] Rob Feeny: 😬
[2020-03-31, 9:27:56 AM] Jamie: No of course not. Haha
[2020-03-31, 9:28:10 AM] Jamie: My Spanish is better than that. I got the gist
[2020-03-31, 9:28:56 AM] Jamie: K doing dark. Later
[2020-03-31, 9:29:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Adios
[2020-04-01, 10:55:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey Morgan gave me some of your stuff. Sweater, Sonos, protein. I'm wearing the sweater, eating the protein and setting the Sonos up on my kitchen, just FYI
[2020-04-01, 10:56:25 AM] Jamie: Lol like you fit in my sweater, Gordo
[2020-04-01, 10:56:57 AM] Jamie: But the Sonos will sound good. I. Any believe it took him 5 months to drop that stuff off
[2020-04-01, 10:57:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha it's Morgan...
[2020-04-01, 10:58:29 AM] Jamie: That sonos has suprisingly good sound. I wonder if you can edit the frequency and use it as a mid in your living room?
[2020-04-01, 11:00:09 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm well I'm lacking sound in the kitchen and the LR seems ok
[2020-04-01, 11:00:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Does it have inputs? I'd connect my Chromecast audio
[2020-04-01, 11:00:40 AM] Jamie: Perfect then. Mostly just curious if you could
[2020-04-01, 11:00:58 AM] Jamie: Yeah I think it has one but I forget exactly
[2020-04-01, 11:10:23 AM] Rob Feeny: I'll check at home. I can babysit it for you 🤣
[2020-04-01, 11:11:43 AM] Jamie: No problem. I can’t use it right now. I’m interested to see what internet I will even have at the RV. Might have to somehow run a cable from the router at Dave’s camp into the trailer s d then get my MacBook to create a network
[2020-04-01, 11:24:04 AM] Rob Feeny: True. Or get a data plan with a ton of data. I pay $65 a month and have 18gb
[2020-04-01, 11:24:15 AM] Jamie: Through who?
[2020-04-01, 11:24:32 AM] Rob Feeny: Fido. All the players have stepped up their game
[2020-04-01, 11:25:08 AM] Jamie: Haha except Koodo. $50 for 5 g, no contract though because I take the number when I go to Ecuador
[2020-04-01, 11:25:14 AM] Jamie: You are contracted?
[2020-04-01, 11:26:07 AM] Rob Feeny: Nope, month to month
[2020-04-01, 11:26:20 AM] Rob Feeny: Bring your own device plan
[2020-04-01, 11:26:34 AM] Rob Feeny: I think the plan has 15gb plus I got a bonus 3gb
[2020-04-01, 11:26:36 AM] Jamie: Ok I will check it out.
[2020-04-01, 11:26:50 AM] Rob Feeny: But I guess Netflix and torrents can eat that up
[2020-04-01, 11:27:13 AM] Rob Feeny: I could mail you a homemade 100' match cable
[2020-04-01, 11:27:18 AM] Rob Feeny: Patch
[2020-04-01, 11:27:52 AM] Jamie: I might take you up on that. Let me check it out today. Thanks
[2020-04-01, 11:28:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Although they're only $20 on Amazon
[2020-04-01, 3:44:59 PM] Jamie: Somehow, the wifi works from the cabin in every corner of the RV. 25mbs. I’m so set up
‎[2020-04-01, 3:45:04 PM] Jamie: ‎video omitted
[2020-04-01, 3:48:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow that shower is bigger than mine!
[2020-04-01, 3:49:54 PM] Jamie: Haha it’s true. I won’t be using it though. The cabin who’s power I am using has a shower, toilet and sink that I will use.
[2020-04-03, 2:03:43 PM] Jamie: You must have an insanely custom plan on Fido. I found 7GB for $65
[2020-04-03, 2:04:20 PM] Rob Feeny: I got in on the 10gb for $60 but really to get the best deals you need to talk to someone. Tried calling in?
[2020-04-03, 2:04:41 PM] Jamie: Not yet. If I call to activate they want $40
[2020-04-03, 2:05:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Ouch, ok. I've just always gotten the best deals talking to a human. They tend to know the deals. Especially if you say you're coming from a different carrier.
[2020-04-03, 2:08:49 PM] Jamie: True. I’m sure they want e commission right now b
‎[2020-04-03, 9:10:42 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-04-04, 12:57:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Not so bad at all... Just installed it?
[2020-04-04, 12:58:00 AM] Rob Feeny: Bring on the Netflix marathons
[2020-04-04, 10:50:58 AM] Jamie: Lol, it’s photo shop
[2020-04-04, 10:57:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha didn't even notice
[2020-04-04, 10:57:40 AM] Jamie: That’s cuz I got mad skills
[2020-04-04, 11:14:10 AM] Rob Feeny: ... or I was tired?
[2020-04-04, 11:24:19 AM] Jamie: Nope. Mad skil. I requested a refund for my original flight home and it look like the refunded the entire thing. We will see if they catch it
[2020-04-04, 11:27:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Awesome! And I just saw the US government is saying airlines just refund instead of giving credits
[2020-04-04, 11:42:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Man, integrating all of Sheila's stuff into the suite is a lot of work!
[2020-04-04, 11:47:10 AM] Jamie: Lol good time to become minimalist
[2020-04-07, 8:13:56 PM] Rob Feeny: How's Quarantine?
[2020-04-07, 8:46:37 PM] Jamie: Not so bad. Sucks not being able to shop for myself though.
[2020-04-07, 8:47:31 PM] Jamie: Dave dropped Jilly off for a few hours today so I took her to a nearby park. Was nice to get out of the RV
[2020-04-07, 8:47:50 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet. How many days left? Scratching them on the wall?
[2020-04-07, 8:48:58 PM] Jamie: Haha not really. Not much will change for the first bit. I might stay here for a few more weeks and chill. Once I can get my own groceries and leave I’d i want, this place is pretty nice
[2020-04-07, 8:49:11 PM] Jamie: Still 9 days left
[2020-04-08, 8:20:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Mind if I use your Sonos for now?
[2020-04-08, 8:21:04 PM] Jamie: Go hard. I’d rather have someone use it than it sitting.
[2020-04-08, 8:21:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Sweet. It's probably all configured for your system still tho hey?
[2020-04-08, 8:23:20 PM] Jamie: The sonos should be fine. If I remember correctly  the controller (phone, iPad etc) is what changes, so that’s what gets reset. Sometimes though you just have to reset the Sonos unit to get any controller to connect
[2020-04-08, 8:29:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok ok I'll look into it tonight. Some music in the kitchen would be nice
[2020-04-08, 8:32:26 PM] Jamie: Sweet. You really need to check out this RV. It’s unbelievable how comfortable it is
[2020-04-10, 12:43:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah? Want to send an outside shot? How long?
‎[2020-04-10, 12:43:54 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-04-10, 12:44:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Found these in my keys. They're yours aren't they?
[2020-04-10, 12:44:17 PM] Jamie: Yes. To my condo in Calgary
[2020-04-10, 12:54:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect I'll put them in your boxes
[2020-04-11, 4:53:36 PM] Jamie: https://youtu.be/birKtIe7HRY
[2020-04-11, 4:55:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Crazy. Is it spring loaded?
[2020-04-11, 4:55:34 PM] Jamie: I think so.
[2020-04-11, 4:58:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Yikes. Looks vicious. But cool.
[2020-04-11, 4:59:05 PM] Rob Feeny: I have too damn many knives tho haha
[2020-04-12, 2:03:33 PM] Jamie: Did you get the Sonos working?
[2020-04-12, 2:22:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup! It doesn't integrate with my google stuff but Sheila can play on it too. Thanks!
[2020-04-12, 2:22:36 PM] Jamie: No worries
[2020-04-12, 2:23:33 PM] Jamie: Looks like there were infected people on my flight. I was in row 24 and rows 29-35 were exposed.
[2020-04-12, 2:23:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Add an extra week to your quarantine?
[2020-04-12, 2:26:06 PM] Jamie: I don’t think so. I was incredibly careful and have no symptoms. Of course, not much will change after I’m out of quarantine but I want to shop for myself. And go to the emergency room to have my shoulder x rayed / looked at. It’s really fucked up and out of place.
[2020-04-12, 2:26:54 PM] Jamie: I don’t think Dave and his guys can get the trailer into moms yard until May/June so I will continue to live out here
[2020-04-12, 2:36:57 PM] Rob Feeny: That sucks man. Sorry to hear it.
[2020-04-13, 10:34:10 AM] Jamie: Just realized the flaw in my cell phone plan. When I ported my number to a service, Koodo closed my account. So I had to create a new account to get a SIM card and they did a hard credit check, dropping my credit score by 20 points. I wonder if this will happen every year?
‎[2020-04-13, 10:35:19 AM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-04-13, 11:40:14 AM] Rob Feeny: So are you sticking around long enough to want your Dyson vac back? Just deciding whether to keep Sheila's vacuum
[2020-04-13, 11:55:00 AM] Jamie: Funny I was going to ask about that. I would like it back to put in the RV. No hurry
[2020-04-13, 11:59:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok, when we can travel again 🤣
[2020-04-13, 12:02:19 PM] Jamie: Right? I would love to come to Vancouver in the next couple of weeks and help morgan with the install but it just doesn’t make sense to take that risk. I can sit on my computer through zoom and instruct someone to do it live with all the digital data I have in front of me to guide them. It’s easier for me. If I’m on site working the tools, I have to keep splitting my awareness between installing and referencing.
[2020-04-13, 12:42:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha yep, video tech helps, but it'll be annoying too
[2020-04-14, 11:03:34 AM] Jamie: https://www.reddit.com/r/DidntKnowIWantedThat/comments/g0udk9/for_annoying_guests/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

[2020-04-14, 2:39:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh the arrogance
[2020-04-14, 2:39:39 PM] Rob Feeny: He never once asked me how I was doing financially or if I was going to have trouble paying rent.
[2020-04-14, 2:40:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Plus just was bragging to me that without all their dinners and going out, he had a ton of money just piling up in the bank
[2020-04-14, 2:40:34 PM] Rob Feeny: But I could probably go 6 months without work before he'd need to subsidize me
[2020-04-14, 11:13:23 PM] Rob Feeny: I take it you don't agree?
[2020-04-14, 11:53:14 PM] Jamie: I can see both sides. And this seems like totally normal behaviour for Dan. The rent relief thing is weird but I think he just worked it into his calculations
[2020-04-15, 12:02:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Yeah in the past he's used the excuse that money was tight. It just greatly bothered me how he was braggy about all his stockpile of cash then assumed I couldn't take care of myself
[2020-04-15, 12:03:05 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm going to buy a dishwasher and then take it out and sell it when I leave.
[2020-04-15, 12:04:02 AM] Rob Feeny: I saved the cabinet I took out
[2020-04-15, 11:05:52 AM] Rob Feeny: How's the isolation? Are you doing any working or learning?
[2020-04-15, 11:11:08 AM] Jamie: Morning dude. Ahh yeah, I’m attending CEDIA webinars and LeGrand (owner of Vantage Controls) webinars weekly and then also going through the old recorder webinars. Networking, product specs, LED dimming etc. Also TED talks, usually a couple a day
[2020-04-15, 11:11:23 AM] Jamie: The IP networking one is pretty good.
[2020-04-15, 11:11:44 AM] Rob Feeny: Nice, gearing up to get back into the industry in some way?
[2020-04-15, 11:13:54 AM] Jamie: Yeah. Remote programming and tech support. I have a line through some old clients on some other vantage jobs and programming. And I have been offering troubleshooting for free on Reddit forums like r/electrician and r/homeautomation for a while just to keep sharp
[2020-04-15, 11:15:12 AM] Jamie: I think I can be pretty good tech support remotely, solving issues while the tech is installing, documenting without the site guy stopping.
[2020-04-15, 11:15:34 AM] Rob Feeny: I bet. Especially with the increased adoption of remote tech these days
[2020-04-15, 11:15:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Ever played with Slack? It's great for managing jobs remotely. One channel for each build erc
[2020-04-15, 11:16:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Etc
[2020-04-15, 11:16:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Gotta drive for a bit
[2020-04-15, 11:16:14 AM] Jamie: Yes. People would be more willing to pay for a video call or zoom meeting
[2020-04-15, 11:17:07 AM] Rob Feeny: For sure, for that part. But for job management in general, it's a very useful tool. I use it with my data entry/accounting people
[2020-04-15, 11:32:34 AM] Jamie: Yeah I used it at the coding bootcamp. Where you headed?
[2020-04-15, 11:42:03 AM] Rob Feeny: Walmart for meds. Got to work today without my steel toes, decided to call it a mental health day. It's a big site, lots of people and I have to wear hardhat, vest, steel toes, glasses and gloves. Add my mask on top of that and it's hell
[2020-04-15, 11:42:30 AM] Rob Feeny: It's the Slack Vancouver offices actually. Construction is going full tilt still with little to no changes due to COVID
[2020-04-15, 11:43:03 AM] Jamie: Where did you get that job? And what’s your scope?
[2020-04-15, 11:44:26 AM] Rob Feeny: It's with Josh Wright. Been on it since the prewiring. One of 4 guys including Josh. We're into finishing now. And I'm just another grunt, slapping up info screens etc at this point
[2020-04-15, 11:45:30 AM] Jamie: That’s pretty good. No management stress for you
[2020-04-15, 11:46:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Ha yeah but it's full city worker style. Lots of waiting for parts and info. I honestly desperately want it to be over. But 2.5 more weeks to go.
[2020-04-15, 11:47:44 AM] Jamie: Everyday? Shit that’s good work these days isn’t it? I get how every job sucks at the end though. Just dying for a change, lol
[2020-04-15, 11:48:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep. That site is a disaster. Messy, dirty, behind, slow... And you have to clarify every single thing, like moving something an inch
[2020-04-15, 11:49:16 AM] Rob Feeny: And no, there's tons of construction going on. I have three different people bugging me for work
[2020-04-15, 11:51:54 AM] Jamie: Keep an ear out for remote programming or troubleshooting lol
[2020-04-15, 12:03:32 PM] Jamie: I’m happy you have managed to build yourself a business Rob
[2020-04-15, 12:03:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Will do
[2020-04-15, 12:17:43 PM] Jamie: Oh and the LeGrand networking videos are really good. I learned quite a bit
[2020-04-15, 12:18:40 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks man. I honestly want out badly, but for now it works. The van was supposed to help with that but now my rentals are at zero.
[2020-04-15, 12:18:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, well I can scope them out. Where are they posted?

[2020-04-15, 4:20:02 PM] Jamie: Yup.
[2020-04-15, 4:20:17 PM] Jamie: And he is going to come get me and drive me back after.
[2020-04-15, 4:20:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow, what service
[2020-04-15, 4:22:10 PM] Jamie: Lol. Right? I’m sure he will be happy to have someone to help with the electrical side of it on site. And I think I can control the virus vectors and still work. It will break up sitting in the RV too
[2020-04-15, 4:22:37 PM] Rob Feeny: I bet. He and Andrew are too busy to handle it all?
[2020-04-15, 4:22:45 PM] Rob Feeny: It's good money for you
[2020-04-15, 4:23:39 PM] Jamie: Totally. A weeks work is $2k
[2020-04-15, 4:24:49 PM] Jamie: Don’t think so. It’s a big complicated job with lots of electrical rewiring and he has to do the av as well. I’m thinking he just wants someone competent and to hang out
[2020-04-15, 4:25:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Smart on his part.
[2020-04-16, 9:53:50 AM] Jamie: I have to say I’m a little nervous about leaving quarantine today. Between Ecuador and here, it’s over 5 weeks
[2020-04-16, 9:54:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha it'll feel weird in sure
[2020-04-16, 9:56:16 AM] Jamie: And I have to go to KGH
[2020-04-16, 10:00:15 AM] Rob Feeny: Why?
[2020-04-16, 10:00:23 AM] Rob Feeny: For your x-ray?
[2020-04-16, 10:00:56 AM] Jamie: Yes. Or MRI. To get referred to a orthopaedic surgeon
[2020-04-16, 8:40:53 PM] Jamie: You’re welcome!

[2020-04-16, 8:43:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Risky click of the day?
[2020-04-16, 8:43:22 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm dubious
[2020-04-16, 8:43:35 PM] Jamie: It’s...
[2020-04-16, 8:44:17 PM] Jamie: I’m not sure how to describe it other than...wow
[2020-04-16, 8:48:41 PM] Jamie: Did ya click on it?
[2020-04-16, 8:49:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope not yet
[2020-04-16, 8:49:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Still waffling
[2020-04-16, 8:49:18 PM] Jamie: Lol
[2020-04-16, 8:49:39 PM] Jamie: It’s got tits in it 😉
[2020-04-16, 8:50:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahahaha
[2020-04-16, 8:50:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, I have a tipsy gf so...
[2020-04-16, 8:50:14 PM] Rob Feeny: I got tits too!
[2020-04-16, 8:50:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Fine...
[2020-04-16, 8:50:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeahhh no
[2020-04-16, 8:50:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Just not starting that video
[2020-04-16, 8:50:47 PM] Jamie: Hahahahahahahahaha

[2020-04-16, 8:52:18 PM] Jamie: Unfortunately the bulk barn is not doing refillable containers right now. That would be better
[2020-04-17, 11:34:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Totally. What's the stuff on the bottom right?
[2020-04-17, 11:34:24 AM] Jamie: Hemp seed
[2020-04-17, 11:40:54 AM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh Nice
[2020-04-17, 11:45:16 AM] Jamie: Yeah it’s crazy full of protein. But gets stuck in my teeth like nothing I have every experienced, lol
[2020-04-17, 11:48:24 AM] Rob Feeny: I can drop your protein off too. When do you arrive?
[2020-04-17, 11:48:57 AM] Jamie: Just working that out. Probably late Sunday night. Looks like Morgan is sending Emilie to pick me up. Lol
[2020-04-17, 11:49:07 AM] Jamie: Are my boots there?
[2020-04-17, 11:49:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Btw if you see Rob Autar when you're here, expect him to beak off about me. I charged him interest (as per the terms on my invoices) when he didn't pay me for 3 months. When he paid, he didn't pay the interest. I have kept sending him invoices and statements for the interest on the interest. He finally responded the other day and I basically told him I'll wait until it gets big enough and sell it to a collection agency
[2020-04-17, 11:50:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm not at my place
[2020-04-17, 11:50:24 AM] Rob Feeny: But I can grab your Sonos, hoodie, protein and vacuum
[2020-04-17, 11:50:28 AM] Jamie: Lol ideally I don’t see him
[2020-04-17, 11:50:28 AM] Rob Feeny: Need anything from the files?
[2020-04-17, 11:50:34 AM] Jamie: Nope
[2020-04-17, 11:50:46 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha yeah I hope not to see him again as well
[2020-04-17, 11:51:10 AM] Jamie: I have no use for the Sonos right now. The RV has a better stereo. You can keep that in your kitchen for now
[2020-04-17, 12:09:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh sweet.
[2020-04-18, 6:56:47 PM] Jamie: I don’t _need_ this wallet but I  _want_ th is wallet
[2020-04-18, 6:56:54 PM] Jamie: https://www.trayvax.com/collections/wallets-all/products/ascent?variant=12237504249931
[2020-04-18, 7:31:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Very swanky...
[2020-04-18, 7:31:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha but yikes, $60 US
[2020-04-18, 7:32:25 PM] Jamie: Yes it’s a little pricey. I don’t even need a new wallet. I’m just collecting a list of thing I might want done say. lol
[2020-04-18, 7:32:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha dangerous!
[2020-04-18, 7:34:14 PM] Jamie: Nah. Somethings I have in my list for 3 years and can’t bring myself to spend the money. But I can dream!
[2020-04-18, 7:38:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep and leave them on your wishlist
[2020-04-18, 7:38:12 PM] Rob Feeny: I get it
[2020-04-18, 7:38:31 PM] Rob Feeny: I just spent $150 today on the stuff to make a hot rock sauna in the back yard. Oops
‎[2020-04-18, 7:44:08 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-04-18, 7:44:36 PM] Jamie: Haha that bored huh? The sauna is for people?
[2020-04-18, 7:45:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yes, Sheila and I tonight. We'll heat rocks in the fire pit
[2020-04-18, 8:08:26 PM] Jamie: Nice. No lake to jump into though. Maybe the sprinkler?
[2020-04-18, 8:08:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha not a bad idea
‎[2020-04-18, 8:25:22 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-04-18, 8:25:52 PM] Jamie: Are those the rocks? Or is there food too?
[2020-04-18, 8:26:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Rocks on the right, food in foil. More rocks go in when the food is dobe
‎[2020-04-18, 8:26:30 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-04-18, 8:26:43 PM] Rob Feeny: More rocks heating with an electric charcoal starter
[2020-04-18, 8:26:52 PM] Jamie: Haha going all out
[2020-04-18, 8:34:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Gotta do something... Can't go anywhere!
[2020-04-20, 10:19:42 AM] Jamie: https://www.reddit.com/r/PandemicPreps/comments/g4u38q/fyi_free_self_reliance_mini_courses_from_mother/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
[2020-04-20, 10:35:29 AM] Rob Feeny: Very cool thanks
[2020-04-20, 10:36:01 AM] Jamie: Better than the last thing I sent you?
[2020-04-20, 10:41:04 AM] Rob Feeny: You suck
[2020-04-21, 2:12:15 PM] Rob Feeny: You in town now?
[2020-04-21, 2:19:34 PM] Jamie: Yup
[2020-04-21, 2:20:39 PM] Jamie: Hey I thought my boots were at moms but they aren’t.  Did you say there were not at your place either?
[2020-04-21, 2:20:51 PM] Jamie: I hope I didn’t leave them with Morgan and he lost them
[2020-04-21, 2:21:12 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope. I think Morgan said he had them
[2020-04-21, 2:22:43 PM] Jamie: Hmm ok. Looks like Morgan (and the 3 sales reps) fucked up the Vantage order and we are missing some of the main pieces. Meaning we can’t start. I knew better than to trust someone else to get it right 😡
[2020-04-21, 2:23:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh man. Sounds like our job today. Got an ETA?
[2020-04-21, 2:25:40 PM] Jamie: I can’t even be sure Morgan has ordered it yet. Minimum 7 business days which puts us at least 1 week behind. I really didn’t expect to be sitting for a week and a half at Fairmont without anything to do
[2020-04-21, 2:26:55 PM] Jamie: I actually got so mad at him last night that I had to put myself to bed because I wasn’t going to be able to shake my bad mood. He never even opened the boxes or checked the packing slip.
[2020-04-21, 2:37:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Typical Morgan style tho. And there's nothing you can do in the meantime?
[2020-04-21, 2:47:03 PM] Jamie: Not really. The power supply for the main brain didn’t get ordered and the connection piece for the dimmer modules also didn’t get ordered. We could maybe kill a day
[2020-04-21, 4:28:40 PM] Rob Feeny: That blows. Want to rent the van for a week and get the eff out of Dodge?
[2020-04-21, 4:28:55 PM] Jamie: Haha tempting.
[2020-04-22, 10:48:05 AM] Jamie: https://charger.nitecore.com/product/fsp100
[2020-04-22, 12:05:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn very slick. 100w
[2020-04-22, 12:05:28 PM] Rob Feeny: How much?
[2020-04-22, 12:34:43 PM] Jamie: Not sure. Looking for a Canadian supplier and not finding it. Some people sell the flashlights but not every SKU
[2020-04-22, 1:39:24 PM] Jamie: Hey Morgan seems to think my boots were in the bottom of that reusable shopping bag he gave you. I guess they weren’t?
[2020-04-22, 1:54:16 PM] Rob Feeny: To be honest I didn't look, I'll ask Sheila to right now
[2020-04-22, 1:56:41 PM] Jamie: Appreciate it
[2020-04-22, 2:02:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep they're in the bag. I got some reason thought I remembered Morgan mentioning keeping them at his place
[2020-04-22, 2:03:06 PM] Jamie: Fantastic!!! I’m so happy I didn’t lose them. Ok i can probably borrow the jeep to come grab this stuff at some point today. Let me know what works
[2020-04-22, 2:04:03 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, Sheila is home all day, I'll send you her number
‎[2020-04-22, 2:05:25 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎Contact card omitted
[2020-04-25, 4:56:31 PM] Rob Feeny: Did you find something to keep you entertained while you wait?
[2020-04-25, 4:57:09 PM] Jamie: Actually we got the equipment Thursday and went in yesterday. Got tonneau done
[2020-04-25, 4:57:24 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah that's awesome. How long is it going to take you?
[2020-04-25, 4:58:01 PM] Jamie: 6-7 days I figure. I would like to go back to Kelowna May 6
[2020-04-25, 4:59:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah? Itching to sort out a life there? You'll stick around until you have surgery and recover?
[2020-04-25, 5:03:25 PM] Jamie: I think I like Kelowna better than Vancouver. And yeah I am working my way through the medicinal system in Kelowna. Had a video appointment with a sports doctor and I am expecting a call from a clinic for an ultrasound appointment. Need to see the state of my tendons
[2020-04-25, 5:03:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome, glad there's some progress
[2020-04-25, 5:04:09 PM] Rob Feeny: and I'm with you, better network and vibe for you there
[2020-05-04, 10:29:57 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey need anything from your boxes? I've got them all pulled out to do some work
[2020-05-04, 10:30:49 PM] Jamie: Ahh maybe just the blue sweater but nothing from the files
[2020-05-05, 11:32:16 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. I'll ask Sheila to find the sweater
[2020-05-05, 11:53:09 AM] Jamie: Cool. Looks like I am not leaving until Thursday because there might be bad weather on Wednesday
[2020-05-05, 11:55:51 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok. Hmmm what's the sweater look like?
[2020-05-05, 11:56:31 AM] Jamie: Didn’t you say there was a hoody? I though you meant the big wool blue one
[2020-05-05, 11:56:59 AM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I thought there was a hoodie in the bag with the protein?
[2020-05-05, 11:57:24 AM] Rob Feeny: I don't actually recall, Sheila reorganized everything. I'm having her look for it, said Hoodie now not sweater. I'll see what she finds
[2020-05-05, 11:57:27 AM] Rob Feeny: I'm @ work
[2020-05-05, 12:01:45 PM] Jamie: It’s the smoking jacket. You have a similar one. It might be at moms. No big deal
[2020-05-05, 12:22:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmm yeah I don't think it's at my house but I set a reminder to look when I get home
[2020-05-05, 12:23:26 PM] Jamie: Sounds good. Thx
[2020-05-13, 1:59:34 PM] Rob Feeny: I finally watched that Networking video, it was quite interesting, thanks
[2020-05-13, 1:59:52 PM] Rob Feeny: Feel free to keep sharing, I'm slowly figuring stuff out. I've been listening to it while driving
[2020-05-13, 2:00:01 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm still working like 60hrs a week
[2020-05-13, 2:01:19 PM] Jamie: Glad to hear. I’m in full on learning mode. I have been sitting at my computer since 8 and I was going to run an hour ago but it’s exciting!
[2020-05-13, 2:01:31 PM] Jamie: Good for the wallet
[2020-05-13, 2:01:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha nice, good industry to be in
[2020-05-19, 6:03:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha now the van has primo WiFi, added some bomber WiFi hotspots, so the one in the shed covers the van
[2020-05-19, 6:03:24 PM] Rob Feeny: How's your trailer?
[2020-05-19, 6:03:53 PM] Jamie: What are bomber wifi hotspots?
[2020-05-19, 6:04:30 PM] Jamie: The RV is great, cooking up great meals Hera and sleeping well
[2020-05-19, 6:05:46 PM] Rob Feeny: I mean good ones. Older unifi hotspots from a hotel that we replaced with newer ones
[2020-05-19, 6:05:56 PM] Rob Feeny: 400ft range
[2020-05-19, 6:06:03 PM] Rob Feeny: You get it moved yet?
[2020-05-19, 6:06:13 PM] Jamie: Holy crap, that’s awesome.
[2020-05-19, 6:06:45 PM] Rob Feeny: I also finally got Ethernet out to the shed for the hotspot/cameras
[2020-05-19, 6:07:47 PM] Jamie: Nope, Daves really busy right now and his guys are working 12s. I told him it’s not that big a deal, I’m happy out here. I have a guy that does Lake Country on Friday’s for $50 to empty the tanks so that is solved.
[2020-05-19, 6:08:06 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect
[2020-05-19, 6:08:19 PM] Rob Feeny: Looking to buy a trailer now?
[2020-05-19, 6:09:45 PM] Jamie: Dave seems to be cool just letting me use this one. It’s better than anything I could find anyway. If he ever asks, I’m happy to buy it for maybe $10k but I don’t think he will. He is happy to have it being used. No point in me spending the money if I don’t have to
[2020-05-19, 6:10:55 PM] Jamie: I am a little sick of being on the computer / phone so much. Out here, not tons to do, and because of COVID I can’t get to coffee shops
[2020-05-19, 6:41:23 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha I bet.
[2020-05-19, 6:41:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Running etc?
[2020-05-19, 6:42:18 PM] Jamie: Yup. Ran 10km on Knox today with my buddy Ryan. Physically distant and all that. We go a couple times a week and it is my salvation
[2020-05-19, 7:13:42 PM] Rob Feeny: That's awesome. I'm missing something like that. All I get is walking up 8 stories of stairs at work because the freight elevator has been down for a week
[2020-05-19, 9:13:59 PM] Jamie: Haha I suppose that’s good depending on what you are carrying.
[2020-05-19, 9:16:11 PM] Jamie: Just finished a delicious dinner. I cube and cook sweet potatoes and chicken breast in bulk. I add it to everything. So tonight was vegetable sauce (all my fresh veggies that I slow cooked and froze before I left, unthawed, blended and simmered) over scrambled eggs / sweet potatoe / chicken. And hot sauce of course. So delicious and healthy
[2020-05-20, 10:00:29 AM] Jamie: Hey dude, happy birthday. What do you have planned?
[2020-05-20, 10:15:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Not a lot, Sheila is making me dinner after work, I'm going to cut the lawn, we'll eat outside and then a video call with Dad & Cathy
[2020-05-20, 10:15:33 AM] Rob Feeny: A nice chill day. And thanks
[2020-05-20, 10:15:48 AM] Rob Feeny: Tmr birthday socially distant drinks in the park with Daniel
[2020-05-20, 10:17:17 AM] Jamie: Little bit of a change from past years. I had hoped to plan my return this year at the end of April to spend the following 3 weeks in Van to be in town for your birthday but this year didn’t work out. Next year
[2020-05-20, 10:17:45 AM] Rob Feeny: All good. I had planned to resume bday BBQs but maybe next year
[2020-05-20, 10:18:44 AM] Jamie: Look like a good bday for you. Flush with cash and a great girlfriend!
[2020-05-20, 10:48:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha I don't know about flush but closer to zero!
[2020-05-22, 1:35:46 AM] Rob Feeny: https://www.burnabynow.com/news/burnaby-wasn-t-vengeful-overreaching-in-dispute-with-pizzeria-court-1.24139139
[2020-06-05, 10:04:15 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow, after all this time, Rob Autar actually paid the interest I have been billing him fot
[2020-06-05, 10:05:04 AM] Jamie: Haha must have been a mistake
[2020-06-05, 10:05:12 AM] Jamie: How much was the interest?
[2020-06-05, 10:07:05 AM] Rob Feeny: $84
[2020-06-05, 10:07:36 AM] Rob Feeny: haha it was more about him jerking me around on payment, having me come down to the office twice for cheques that weren't there, then making me wait 3 months for it
[2020-06-05, 10:07:53 AM] Rob Feeny: I totally thought he'd just pay his latest invoice for $1.72
[2020-06-05, 10:08:02 AM] Rob Feeny: Interest on interest
[2020-06-05, 10:12:01 AM] Jamie: Hey that’s $84!
[2020-06-05, 10:12:36 AM] Jamie: I’m struggling to get money out of Morgan right now. Apparently the check has been lost and the money transfer has been over a week
[2020-06-05, 10:14:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Yeahhhh same here. He's telling me QuickTech is behind on payments
[2020-06-05, 10:15:23 AM] Rob Feeny: Not sure what's going on with him these days. He's struggling a lot. I think he used all that lighting job money to pay his debts and now has no operating capital
[2020-06-05, 10:17:45 AM] Jamie: I think so too. We made that job so incredibly profitable for him. Billed the client $58,000 worth of equipment then we shaved it to about $18-20k. He should have had over 50k profit in that job
[2020-06-05, 10:20:21 AM] Rob Feeny: Wow... But I think had built a huge backlog. I bet it saved him from a second bankruptcy
[2020-06-05, 10:21:03 AM] Jamie: He also got $40k from the government, I think he gets to keep $10k
[2020-06-05, 10:25:04 AM] Jamie: It sucks that it used to be us vs the world (as in Morgan and I always helping each other out first) but at some point it became Morgan vs the world and I am in the world part. So he tries to “manage” me and feed me bullshit. Most of the time I see it and don’t care but he couldn’t have done this job without me
[2020-06-05, 10:25:49 AM] Jamie: Sure glad I don’t need the money
[2020-06-05, 10:30:41 AM] Rob Feeny: What from? COVID help?
[2020-06-05, 10:31:05 AM] Rob Feeny: Yeah I like the guy but not the company he keeps and it gets hard to be friends with him or do business with him at times
[2020-06-05, 10:33:43 AM] Jamie: Yup
[2020-06-05, 10:34:38 AM] Rob Feeny: Yikes. Although they kept working through most of it
[2020-06-05, 10:35:13 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey I heard a funny-to-me tidbit throught Sheila/Kyla that might make you laugh/shake your head if you haven't heard it
[2020-06-05, 10:35:31 AM] Jamie: What’s that?
[2020-06-05, 10:35:47 AM] Rob Feeny: Evidently Emilie thought you had a thing for her while you were staying there
[2020-06-05, 10:36:06 AM] Rob Feeny: Thought you'd be going for her if it wasn't for Morgan
[2020-06-05, 10:39:17 AM] Rob Feeny: It was just funny to me as it seemed she was driving you nuts
[2020-06-05, 10:39:24 AM] Jamie: Haha that makes sense. I was trying really hard to like her this trip, and was being extra nice. At one point I said, I was happy that I was getting to know her better. 

I actually thought it was the other way around. She paraded around in the skimpiest clothing. I saw her tits like 4 times and I think she was doing it on purpose
[2020-06-05, 10:39:56 AM] Rob Feeny: Bahahaha man, she likes attention?
[2020-06-05, 10:40:17 AM] Rob Feeny: Morgan probably would have let you sleep with her. He basically told Kyla that it was cool to sleep with me
[2020-06-05, 10:40:48 AM] Jamie: Makes sense
[2020-06-05, 10:42:00 AM] Jamie: I still don’t find her attractive. I just realized at one point that she is better than Melissa and she might stick around.
[2020-06-05, 10:43:36 AM] Rob Feeny: It's a weird dynamic for sure. It must suck for Morgan to support Melissa & the kids tho, while trying to have a life with Emilie
[2020-06-05, 10:44:23 AM] Jamie: I’m sure he sees himself as the good guy. Taking care of the kids from a horrible wife and doing his best to find happiness with someone else.
[2020-06-05, 10:44:54 AM] Jamie: This is hilarious.
[2020-06-05, 10:45:09 AM] Rob Feeny: I wonder what the conversion rate is for sugarbaby to life partner?
[2020-06-05, 10:47:09 AM] Jamie: Probably more than I would ever be willing to pay for either woman.
[2020-06-05, 11:01:42 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha I meant more the rate of starting out as a sugarbaby and ending up as a gf/wife. 15%?
[2020-06-05, 11:05:42 AM] Jamie: Oh yeah good question. Morgan is probably an unusual customer for that line of work. A keeper!
[2020-06-05, 11:08:13 AM] Jamie: So I got an email that RBC rewards converted my airline credits back to points, as I requested. Worked out great! They actually gave me 117,000 points (trip to Ecuador AND home) back instead of just half (the trip home was cancelled). Plus the 57,000 points and $517 dollars I paid for another attempt to get home that was cancelled.
[2020-06-05, 11:08:29 AM] Rob Feeny: That's awesome!
[2020-06-05, 11:08:45 AM] Rob Feeny: I also got my credit card to refund me for my cancelled flight
[2020-06-05, 11:08:53 AM] Rob Feeny: Since the airline in in bankruptcy
[2020-06-05, 11:09:06 AM] Jamie: Avían a?
[2020-06-05, 11:09:13 AM] Jamie: Avianca?
[2020-06-05, 11:14:19 AM] Rob Feeny: Yep. They're restructuring. And flubbed my refund 3x
[2020-06-05, 11:17:12 AM] Rob Feeny: Do the points ever expire?
[2020-06-05, 11:17:21 AM] Jamie: No
[2020-06-05, 11:17:33 AM] Jamie: I am still accumulating them on my cards
[2020-06-09, 6:37:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Jay at EECOL says to say hello. They've suspended your account and I can't use it for cash purchases anymore 🤣
[2020-06-09, 6:37:41 PM] Jamie: Haha about time. Almost 3 years
[2020-06-09, 6:37:55 PM] Jamie: Tell him I say hi back
[2020-06-09, 6:39:42 PM] Rob Feeny: The moment I said the name he was like "oh no, I can't do that" haha
[2020-06-09, 6:40:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Then made me show ID. He still gave me decent pricing
[2020-06-09, 6:49:42 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey do they make non-armoured direct burial rated AC wire? We're quoting equipment for Daniel's cabin's water/pump system
[2020-06-09, 6:49:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Or is it just standard Tec that's the only option?
[2020-06-09, 6:50:39 PM] Jamie: I’m pretty sure there is non armoured direct burial. I always wondered why
[2020-06-09, 6:50:58 PM] Jamie: Anything rated U should be for underground
[2020-06-09, 6:51:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok ok, Daniel thought so as well. I wouldn't use it myself but he's worried about price
[2020-06-09, 6:51:48 PM] Jamie: https://www.gescan.com/products/wire-cable/nmwu-cables
[2020-06-11, 12:20:37 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey can you give us any info on this? (incoming wall of text)
[2020-06-11, 12:20:41 PM] Rob Feeny: facebok post "Looking for someone that knows about electrical systems to answer a grounding question.

I am installing a submersible well pump powered by an existing inverter. The inverter is located at the cabin and there is a feeder (Teck) cable from the cabin to the well head; at the well head there is a timer that feeds the pump via a submersible pump cable (3 conductors - Neutral,Phase and Ground).

On the upstream side of the inverter I have a battery bank that is connected via a charge controller to a solar panel bank.

I have three questions:
1. Do I need to ground the system? My assumption is yes even though right now my system - no pump yet - is not grounded.

2. What is the ideal location for the ground? My assumption is close to the inverter, and do not ground the low voltage (solar) side of the system.

3. Is there a ground loop created by the submersible pump? or can I assume that the pump ground is electrically isolated from the water in the well?

If any of this makes sense to you, can you provide advice?

thanks"
[2020-06-11, 12:24:32 PM] Jamie: Too specific for my knowledge. My assumption is to ground at inverter. Pump conductors should be isolated from the water completely and you would not want a short to connect to the to water in any case.
[2020-06-11, 12:26:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok thanks. Daniel is doing research but thought you might have insight. The inverter is just a unit with NEMA receptacles, not made for hardwired connections
[2020-06-11, 12:44:05 PM] Jamie: And there is no grounding point even on the chasis?
[2020-06-11, 12:51:19 PM] Jamie: Often a great resource is the manufacturers of solar. Try solaris-shop.com, I thought I saw some info on system grounding
[2020-06-11, 12:59:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok thanks man. I'll ask him about a grounding point on the chassis
[2020-06-15, 6:24:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Well, working like a dog through the whole COVID drama let me pay off about $13,000 in debt. That feels nice.
[2020-06-15, 6:41:40 PM] Jamie: That’s great dude. Still have some work coming up?
[2020-06-15, 6:41:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Yup. More than I want. Worked all weekend with Rolando too
[2020-06-15, 6:42:23 PM] Rob Feeny: If I grind for 2 more months I'd have only my student loans left
[2020-06-15, 6:42:34 PM] Jamie: That’s fantastic!
[2020-06-15, 6:42:40 PM] Rob Feeny: But I think Sheila would kill me
[2020-06-15, 6:42:55 PM] Jamie: And you would probably just buy another van
[2020-06-15, 6:43:29 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha man's gotta have hobbies!
[2020-06-15, 6:43:43 PM] Rob Feeny: But sadly rentals are still way down. Haven't had one in a while
[2020-06-15, 6:43:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Lots of inquiries but nothing real
[2020-06-15, 6:44:22 PM] Jamie: I’m not surprised. People are just waking up and booking campsites etc
[2020-06-15, 6:45:25 PM] Rob Feeny: How's the okanagan?
[2020-06-15, 6:46:49 PM] Jamie: It’s been wet. Very wet. Today has been beautiful though. I’m running 3 times a week on Knox Mountain with my buddy Ryan. Sunday was 14kms with 400m of incline. A really tough run. But it felt easy so I’m back in decent shape.
[2020-06-15, 6:47:41 PM] Jamie: Got the ultrasound on my shoulder and the doc says tendons are healing fine, no surgery. Still quite a bit of pain but...
[2020-06-15, 6:48:03 PM] Jamie: And we move the RV to moms on Saturday

[2020-06-15, 6:49:20 PM] Jamie: Eduardo says hi, btw. One of Dave’s guys.
[2020-06-15, 6:51:53 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh crazy
So they won't do anything?
[2020-06-15, 6:52:33 PM] Jamie: Nope
[2020-06-15, 6:52:45 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha that'll work, who needs permits? 🤣
[2020-06-15, 6:52:53 PM] Rob Feeny: How do you feel about that?
[2020-06-15, 6:53:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Say Hey back for me, I remember him
[2020-06-15, 6:55:18 PM] Jamie: Well I would like to have my shoulder back in place but at least now I don’t have to worry about damaging it with physio. The ultrasound was the last image I needed to feel confident I wouldn’t tear it. So I’m happy that I can really progress on the rehab now.  If I can get it strong enough to surf, that all I need. The unevenness is now just a good conversation starter...
[2020-06-15, 6:56:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha like a scar!
[2020-06-15, 6:56:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Are you practicing your Spanish with Dave's guys?
[2020-06-15, 6:57:51 PM] Jamie: A little. We were all keeping our distance for the last few months so no real chance other that hola. But now that things are relaxed I see them and actually have mixed conversations of English and Spanish.
[2020-06-15, 6:59:23 PM] Jamie: It will be nice to be closer in town. It’s 30 min to downtown Kelowna and sometimes I’m doing twice a day. That’s a lot of driving.
[2020-06-15, 7:16:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Yikes, yeah. But basically nthe Vancouver norm
[2020-06-15, 7:17:23 PM] Jamie: True. Actually the 1988 Honda Accord is a standard and the road is pretty fun
[2020-06-15, 7:17:36 PM] Jamie: How’s things with Sheila? She living full time with you?
[2020-06-15, 7:19:10 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, she's been here for over 2 months now. Hmm closer to 3?
[2020-06-15, 7:19:12 PM] Rob Feeny: She's amazing
[2020-06-15, 7:19:25 PM] Rob Feeny: It's a great little car
[2020-06-15, 7:19:44 PM] Jamie: Good to hear
[2020-06-15, 7:20:24 PM] Rob Feeny: She's a kind and caring person and good to me. Slightly losing her mind over stress from her new job but getting through it
[2020-06-15, 7:21:00 PM] Jamie: Really what more can you ask for?
[2020-06-15, 7:24:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep. It's been interesting tho, she's an only child, the first one I've ever dated
[2020-06-15, 7:24:27 PM] Rob Feeny: And it shows
[2020-06-15, 7:24:54 PM] Jamie: Doesn’t share well? 😂
[2020-06-15, 7:26:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha well, doesn't do well at having an argument/discussion for the sake of discussion, without it being a fight
[2020-06-15, 7:26:11 PM] Rob Feeny: She at times seems perplexed by the concept
[2020-06-15, 7:27:00 PM] Jamie: Well seems like you guys have found a way to communicate about it
[2020-06-15, 7:28:08 PM] Rob Feeny: Yes we're doing well. It's just interesting to see the differences
[2020-06-15, 7:28:17 PM] Rob Feeny: Anyone interesting in Kelowna?
[2020-06-15, 7:44:28 PM] Jamie: Nah. I went on a date a few days ago and she was interested but I wasn’t.
[2020-06-15, 8:05:47 PM] Rob Feeny: It's an odd little town for dating, it seems
[2020-06-15, 8:14:01 PM] Jamie: Yup. I’m gonna change my profile to “looking for someone to run Knox Mountain with me. Maybe the endorphins will allow us to look past all of our imperfections. Who’s in?”
[2020-06-15, 8:21:18 PM] Jamie: Making plans with people who have a family is annoying. I can’t tell you how many times the “family emergency” excuse is used. Hilarious. It’s such a subjective term and excuses anyone from last minute cancelling, normally a social blunder. Of course it’s always possible but this guy starting back tracking earlier today, maybe having to go pick up an exercise bike,  and then finally cancelled 45 min before with a family emergency. I smelled it coming
[2020-06-15, 8:56:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh yeah. We've been struggling with that too.
[2020-06-15, 8:57:12 PM] Rob Feeny: I guess when we have kids we'll become part of the club?
[2020-06-15, 8:57:25 PM] Rob Feeny: We gave up on one couple after 3 attempts
[2020-06-15, 8:59:23 PM] Jamie: If I really believed it was a family emergency, it would be different. Or at least more context would be more believable. Sorry wife isn’t feeling well. Kid has lice. Dog got the babysitter pregnant. Lol
[2020-06-18, 11:50:24 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey I know you've learned a lot about heart rate monitors... I'm looking to buy one for Sheila but not for normal reasons. She's dealing with a lot of stress at her new job and prone on anxiety attacks
[2020-06-18, 11:51:31 AM] Rob Feeny: I've taught her a lot about breathing exercises to control panic attacks but I think a watch that shows her heart rate (telling her when it's elevated) and helps her see it drop as she breathes, would help
[2020-06-18, 11:56:40 AM] Jamie: Well the Fitbit is the entry to this, but the Apple Watch has more apps that can prioritize panic attacks. Maybe research the Fitbit ecosystem to see what apps they have. She doesn’t have an iPhone does she?
[2020-06-18, 12:07:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Nope, Android, not an Apple fan. I'll scope out the Fitbit. I'm hoping for something super simple with a large HR display so she can count, breathe and watch it drop
[2020-06-18, 12:07:29 PM] Rob Feeny: They've thrown her into the deep end for nursing
[2020-06-18, 12:11:02 PM] Jamie: That’s hard for sure but she will figure it out and it will be a benefit in the future. But for now it’s tough
[2020-06-18, 12:16:55 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. I've finally convinced her that she's an in-demand resource, not desperate for work/approval, so she's starting to ask for more at work (support, guidance etc). They're already offering her full-time positions and she has trouble saying no
[2020-06-18, 12:24:47 PM] Jamie: Reminds me of starting as an electrician during the housing boom in Calgary. Crazy levels of responsibility because there wasn’t enough people. Great boost to my career but definitely stressful.
[2020-06-18, 12:31:20 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha indeed! I remember those days...
[2020-06-18, 12:31:39 PM] Rob Feeny: Great time to be a nurse. She's getting like $43 an hour, 12hr shifts
[2020-06-18, 12:31:48 PM] Jamie: Holy crap!
[2020-06-18, 12:33:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep. And we now pay $300 a month each in rent. She has no car or other expenses besides her phone and student loans
[2020-06-18, 12:38:17 PM] Jamie: Nice to have a girlfriend that is financially literate
[2020-06-18, 12:40:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep. And earning income
[2020-06-18, 2:07:15 PM] Jamie: Someone is posting on r/britishcolumbia looking for RV rental can I link your unit?
[2020-06-18, 2:10:04 PM] Rob Feeny: For sure. Easiest is to send the instagram link @vantasyrentals
[2020-06-18, 2:10:08 PM] Rob Feeny: But I'll send a link

[2020-06-21, 3:22:02 PM] Jamie: We were done by 2pm
[2020-06-21, 3:24:36 PM] Rob Feeny: Awesome. Sweet new digs

[2020-06-21, 3:32:43 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh! For some reason I thought you'd be in the side yard, but I guess that doesn't really exist anymore?
[2020-06-21, 3:33:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Less likely neighbors will say anything this way
[2020-06-21, 3:33:08 PM] Rob Feeny: You need a little patio now
[2020-06-21, 3:34:13 PM] Jamie: There is no side yard really. The hedges are exactly on the property line.
[2020-06-21, 4:12:34 PM] Jamie: Haha on the roof!  But I gave mom my old patio set from Hastings and she never uses it so I will set it up outside the door, under the awning.
[2020-06-22, 1:17:25 PM] Jamie: Hey where do you buy your ultra gentle face cleanser? Shoppers had been out for months now
[2020-06-22, 1:23:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm I've been using the same one for a year! But I thought most places carry it (London drugs? Superstore?)

[2020-06-22, 1:58:29 PM] Rob Feeny: But that one
[2020-07-02, 2:05:43 PM] Rob Feeny: We're taking the van out today, heading through hope, out past Princeton, eventually hitting Lumby and then Saturday night dinner w/ Dad & Cathy. Sunday hanging around Lumby and back home Monday. What's your weekend like?
[2020-07-02, 2:06:00 PM] Rob Feeny: Want to connect at some point? Cliff jumping @ rattlesnake point Sunday?
[2020-07-02, 2:07:18 PM] Jamie: Sure I’m game. I can probably swim but it would be irresponsible of me to jump at this point in my shoulder recovery.
[2020-07-02, 2:08:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ok, well there's still a nice beach. Or some people watching at Kal beach haha
[2020-07-02, 2:29:32 PM] Jamie: I’m happy to get in the water either way
‎[2020-07-03, 8:56:36 PM] Jamie: ‎video omitted
[2020-07-04, 5:01:37 PM] Jamie: Hey are you still thinking about meeting up tomorrow? You are probably at the cabin with no self-service but just text me when you get cell service
[2020-07-04, 5:02:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Hey! We are on our way out to the cabin now, just leaving summerland
[2020-07-04, 5:03:32 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeah totally, we're thinking of hitting the beach at Kal lake or Rattlesnake point around noon or so tomorrow.  We're going to spend the night in Lumby.
[2020-07-04, 5:04:17 PM] Jamie: OK text me when you leave the cabin but I’ll assume it’s going to be around 11 o’clock that you leave the cabin and I leave Kalona
[2020-07-04, 5:04:40 PM] Jamie: No big deal if it’s later
[2020-07-04, 5:04:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Perfect
[2020-07-05, 1:00:01 PM] Rob Feeny: Made it to Lumby, just searching for coffee & food. We'll head to Rattlesnake point when we're done and just see you when you arrive
[2020-07-05, 1:00:25 PM] Jamie: Ok. Should be easy for me to find?
[2020-07-05, 1:00:44 PM] Rob Feeny: Totally. I can send you a pin of the park, we'll stick around the beach there
[2020-07-05, 1:01:58 PM] Jamie: Ok sounds good. I’m making my smoothie and then heading there.
[2020-07-05, 1:36:16 PM] Jamie: If I leave now, will I beat you there?
[2020-07-05, 1:37:25 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe? We'd be there by 12:15. Hard to find coffee in this town on a Sunday!
[2020-07-05, 1:37:54 PM] Jamie: Lol, I bet. There is a Tim Hortons now
[2020-07-05, 1:38:04 PM] Jamie: Did you find that?
[2020-07-05, 1:38:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Yah I just really don't enjoy their coffee
[2020-07-05, 1:38:30 PM] Jamie: Fair enough. Starbucks snob
[2020-07-05, 1:38:31 PM] Rob Feeny: We found a place with a Keurig machine
[2020-07-05, 1:39:09 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I'll take gas station coffee over Tim's
[2020-07-05, 1:39:44 PM] Jamie: Ok I head that way. It will take me around 45 min and I’ll drive slow
[2020-07-05, 2:00:57 PM] Jamie: Do this please. The maps are giving me weird results

[2020-07-11, 11:44:47 AM] Jamie: Hey Rob, can you text me? Not with WhatsApp but sms. I don’t seem to be receiving them
[2020-07-11, 12:22:05 PM] Rob Feeny: Done
[2020-07-11, 12:22:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Just waking up, was up late
[2020-07-11, 12:22:52 PM] Jamie: No worries. Appreciate it. Hope it was a good night
[2020-07-15, 10:14:28 PM] Jamie: I think I used too many fresh Jalapeños in my tacos 🔥
[2020-07-15, 10:15:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahahahaha feeling it?
[2020-07-15, 10:15:26 PM] Rob Feeny: At least you didn't play with your balls right after chopping them?
[2020-07-15, 10:15:54 PM] Jamie: My lips are burning and my balls are fine, thanks for asking.
[2020-07-15, 10:16:05 PM] Jamie: How’s life?
[2020-07-15, 10:21:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Bahaha words to he remembered by. We made a super gingery stir-fry but it didn't burn
[2020-07-15, 10:21:30 PM] Rob Feeny: And life's good. Watching Ready Player One with Sheila
[2020-07-15, 10:21:37 PM] Rob Feeny: You?
[2020-07-15, 10:23:02 PM] Jamie: All good here. I’m not doing much, just running and drinking coffee. Oh but Morgan and I have a few jobs we are working on and I got about 20 hrs last week which is great. And I love the remote programming gig.
[2020-07-15, 10:23:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Ah that's awesome. Decent hourly rate?
[2020-07-15, 10:23:33 PM] Rob Feeny: Sheila wants to know how your date went
[2020-07-15, 10:24:26 PM] Jamie: $50 an hour, billed through my corp so unfortunately taxed. I’m trying to stay low income on my personal taxes
[2020-07-15, 10:25:14 PM] Jamie: Went really well. Had another since then that went well too. We were supposed to go paddling in the lake today but she had to put her cat down suddenly.
[2020-07-15, 10:27:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Oh tragic! But that's awesome, I'm stoked for you man
[2020-07-15, 10:37:52 PM] Rob Feeny: You've turned the Corp into an investment vehicle tho, right?
[2020-07-15, 10:39:12 PM] Jamie: Nope. Technically still an operating company. Very unprofitable, these days, haha
[2020-07-15, 10:42:44 PM] Jamie: I think there is some longer term advantage to keeping it. I have a 10 year borrowing history of the company meaning a $25,000 limit on the visa plus 4 vehicle loans all paid off, so the credit is good.
[2020-07-17, 12:42:54 PM] Jamie: Hey did you say you know a mechanic here? I’m hoping to fix the AC on the Honda.
[2020-07-17, 1:05:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Hmmm not anymore, he retired (cancer)
[2020-07-17, 1:19:11 PM] Jamie: Shitty deal for him. Ok thanks
[2020-07-17, 1:19:47 PM] Rob Feeny: Last I checked, Neil Love (old mechanic from the Glenmore Chevron) was the service manager at the Honda dealership tho
[2020-07-17, 1:25:12 PM] Jamie: Good to know. I’ll check it out
[2020-07-22, 12:05:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Pocket dial
[2020-07-22, 12:16:30 PM] Jamie: Ok
[2020-07-23, 11:37:00 AM] Rob Feeny: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/dji-drones-security-vulnerability.html
[2020-07-23, 3:11:52 PM] Jamie: Crazy. I pretty much assume they are building data sets of where the drones fly and what they see but never thought about the app itself spying.
[2020-07-23, 3:23:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Learning all about Jamie Feeny
[2020-07-23, 3:24:15 PM] Jamie: Naturally I can see myself being one of the pillars of capitalism they would have to conquer before invasion
[2020-07-24, 11:25:40 AM] Rob Feeny: Honestly though, if China used their resources to build a massive database on every North American citizen (which is not tht crazy an idea, given they have BILLIONS of people to our hundreds of millions, they could save it up for a concentrated 'terrorist attack' that could empty the accounts of tens of millions of people at once and cause wreak havoc on the economy.
[2020-07-24, 11:26:32 AM] Rob Feeny: They've already shown they're willing to basically steal all the IP they can, so once they're at an equal tech level, why not steal money as well? War is war.
[2020-07-25, 8:40:32 PM] Jamie: Hey you have a chrome cast right?
[2020-07-25, 8:41:34 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, several of them
[2020-07-25, 8:42:48 PM] Jamie: So if I have a few Nest cams, and a google chromecast plugged into the TV, what do I see when I switch to that input? Is it a menu that I have to then choose the cams?
[2020-07-25, 8:43:42 PM] Rob Feeny: No clue to be honest, I don't use any best cams, just the chromecasts. You don't get anything but the ambient display until you cast something
[2020-07-25, 8:44:44 PM] Jamie: Ahh ok. I’ll keep digging. I want to have a couple cameras around the house but mom and Dave need to be able to view them easily
[2020-08-02, 1:40:52 PM] Rob Feeny: How's life in Kelowna?
[2020-08-02, 3:55:05 PM] Jamie: Not bad. Lost the keys to my car hiking so $420 to get a new key made 😬
[2020-08-02, 3:55:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Holy crap. For the Honda?
[2020-08-02, 6:57:40 PM] Jamie: Yup. Just got it back now. Expensive but at least I am working these days and making cash
[2020-08-02, 6:58:58 PM] Rob Feeny: Online work with Morgan?
[2020-08-02, 7:00:06 PM] Jamie: Nope. Working with one of Jeff Pikes clients and he has so much work. 2 cabins and a main house, finishing and exterior electrical. Super casual, out in Joe Rich
[2020-08-02, 7:02:14 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, probably feels pretty good
[2020-08-02, 7:02:20 PM] Rob Feeny: And the RV setup is working well?
[2020-08-02, 7:02:49 PM] Jamie: Yeah. I made $1000 cash last week and should make $800 next week
[2020-08-02, 7:03:12 PM] Jamie: Really well. It’s a perfect space.
[2020-08-02, 7:03:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Nicely done.
[2020-08-02, 7:03:19 PM] Jamie: Hows life on the coast?
[2020-08-02, 7:03:31 PM] Rob Feeny: I just made $1000 cash myself @ Daniel's cabin
[2020-08-02, 7:03:41 PM] Rob Feeny: It's tiring. Hot work in the sun but learned a ton
[2020-08-02, 7:03:56 PM] Jamie: And you love that stuff
[2020-08-02, 7:12:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, lots of off-grid systems. Stuff I can use one day
[2020-08-02, 7:13:07 PM] Rob Feeny: How's Kelowna outside of work,
[2020-08-02, 7:15:02 PM] Jamie: For me it’s great. I am running every couple of days and lots of beach time. Hanging out with Sien a fair bit so that’s nice. And getting my shoulder back into shape
[2020-08-02, 8:26:07 PM] Rob Feeny: Damn sounds like everything is falling into place
[2020-08-02, 8:26:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Do you have ac in the RV?
[2020-08-02, 8:26:51 PM] Jamie: I do. Ran a cable for that last month. Really enjoying that
[2020-08-02, 8:30:31 PM] Jamie: You have working coming up this week?
[2020-08-02, 8:37:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Ha that makes it bearable
[2020-08-02, 8:38:06 PM] Rob Feeny: I'm doing accounting all week, plus prep for my next rental
[2020-08-06, 1:06:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Looking at coming up this way? I've actually got all the work I can handle these days. Plus just got a contract for later in the fall to do an airstream (all the systems & wiring) on Saltspring Island
[2020-08-06, 1:22:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh This COVID thing is killing me, as I can't go to Starbucks. Sheila just can't wrap her head around working from home and thinks that if I'm not on a jobsite she can chat with me, ask me to do things etc. She has a day off and wants me to have a day off. I've gotten maybe 10% of my work done in the last 2 days
[2020-08-06, 2:01:54 PM] Jamie: Crappy. That’s tough to explain for sure
[2020-08-16, 12:34:12 AM] Jamie: Hung out with mechanic Rob at Tana’s tonight. He actually a pretty personable guy.
[2020-08-16, 5:51:56 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yeah he's a nice guy, quite interesting
[2020-08-16, 5:55:04 PM] Jamie: Totally. But he was funny too!
[2020-08-18, 11:26:13 AM] Jamie: https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/ibzpdx/just_inherited_my_greatgrandmothers_kitchen_aid/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
[2020-08-18, 11:29:25 AM] Rob Feeny: Haha don't know if I'll find one of those!
[2020-08-18, 11:29:44 AM] Jamie: It screams your name!  Haha
[2020-10-16, 5:18:41 PM] Jamie: Carmen Carter says hi!
[2020-10-16, 5:18:58 PM] Rob Feeny: oh my, what a flashback
[2020-10-16, 5:19:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Say Hi in return
[2020-10-16, 5:19:38 PM] Jamie: Yeah just bumped into her and her brother Jed at the Bean Scene.
[2020-10-16, 5:22:30 PM] Rob Feeny: Must be interesting to be back in Kelowna for that reason
‎[2020-10-21, 2:47:39 PM] Jamie: ‎image omitted
[2020-10-21, 2:48:12 PM] Rob Feeny: I actually have a new one now but I'm also using a blade when I need a close shave
[2020-10-21, 2:48:41 PM] Jamie: Ok thought I would ask. I’m going to clean it up and store it, maybe sell it when I get back
[2020-10-21, 3:03:22 PM] Rob Feeny: Back to Ecuador?
[2020-10-21, 3:05:02 PM] Jamie: Yup. I’m actually going to be in Vancouver on Wed - Sun next week before I leave. Maybe a backyard fire?
[2020-10-21, 3:06:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Wow, gutsy. I'm on Saltspring Island Sat to maybe Thursday, not sure, basically I'll leave when the job is done so I'll have to let you know next week
[2020-10-21, 3:09:02 PM] Jamie: Ok no worries.
[2020-10-22, 12:51:23 PM] Rob Feeny: But if you need a place to stay, you can crash, we just won't be around until probably Friday
[2020-10-22, 12:52:21 PM] Jamie: Thanks. Appreciate it. I am staying at Morgan’s, was just hoping to see you/Sheila and the Dan fam before I go
[2020-11-19, 11:01:27 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎Missed voice call
‎[2020-11-19, 11:02:04 AM] Rob Feeny: ‎audio omitted
[2020-11-19, 12:53:10 PM] Jamie: Haha I was at my Spanish lessons.  Thanks bros! Appreciate it
[2020-11-29, 2:01:38 PM] Rob Feeny: How's Ecuador? You back in the same apartment?
[2020-11-29, 2:02:51 PM] Jamie: Hey dude. Ecuador is good, I have been getting out surfing so I’m happy. Currently in Montanita but I have secured an apartment for the 1st. A different one which I think will be better. How’s Van?
[2020-11-29, 2:03:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Nice, are there many travelers around?
[2020-11-29, 2:04:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Van is good, just living life and getting projects sorted. Sheila's off doing AST1 (Avalanche Safety Training) today
[2020-11-29, 2:04:27 PM] Rob Feeny: House is doing well, working as little as possible...
[2020-11-29, 2:07:32 PM] Jamie: Not too many from out of country but on the weekends there are tons of people from Guyaquil and Quito. Latin people have not changed their relationship with physical space very well. I got crowded out of my table at an outdoor restaurant yesterday. This entire family swarmed the table and started sitting down. Immediately I got up and backed away and they sat down. Fuckers.  Offensive use of COVID protocols to get a table...
[2020-11-29, 2:08:03 PM] Jamie: Finances ok?
[2020-11-29, 2:09:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep, I make enough to survive, I'm just using the time to finish all my various little projects that had built up over time. Trying to clear mental clutter.
[2020-11-29, 2:10:02 PM] Rob Feeny: Hahaha sounds about right.
[2020-11-29, 2:10:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Less competition for waves?
[2020-11-29, 2:11:49 PM] Jamie: In Olón yes. But in Montanita there are a lot of local surfers. And it’s been a while since a good swell so people are eager.
[2020-11-29, 2:12:49 PM] Rob Feeny: Ahhh damn. And less cute foreign girls
[2020-11-29, 2:13:16 PM] Rob Feeny: Franco is pushing me to come down for his wedding in April but I don't know if I'm ready for latin america in the times of COVID yet
[2020-11-29, 2:13:26 PM] Rob Feeny: Maybe if we both get it between now and then...
[2020-11-29, 2:13:34 PM] Jamie: Definitely less cute foreign girls. Kind of disappointed...
[2020-11-29, 2:15:26 PM] Jamie: Yeah the tough part is there really is no data here. Many people wearing masks but kind of half assed and some groups 2 people have masks and the rest don’t. Huge groups out for dinner with masks off too. All of the bars are still open and full and with alcohol masks and personal space are gone.
[2020-11-29, 2:15:46 PM] Jamie: I’m happy that I can keep my personal space and pick and choose when to see people.
[2020-11-29, 2:16:41 PM] Rob Feeny: Yeahhhhh. The interesting thing is that now, multiple friends and co-workers of Sheila have gotten it and barely had a sniffle. Her ward at the hospital has an outbreak with 50+ patients.
[2020-11-29, 2:17:07 PM] Rob Feeny: And of the 5 deaths 'due to covid' there, all 5 would have died withing a month or two anyway.
[2020-11-29, 2:17:35 PM] Rob Feeny: So we're stressing less about it, but still wear masks everywhere etc. Mostly it's people like Dad and Cathy I worry about
[2020-11-29, 2:19:27 PM] Jamie: Yes. Dad seemed in pretty good spirits the last time I talked to him, which I was happy to see.
[2020-12-10, 11:27:04 AM] Rob Feeny: Hey, not sure if you're still using my hosting account but I'm updating my passwords everywhere.
[2020-12-10, 11:29:05 AM] Jamie: I am for iphoneAndADrone.com. Not currently working on it through
[2020-12-10, 11:29:36 AM] Rob Feeny: Ok, I think the login for web hosting is different than my overall account for the billing. I'll try to sort it and send you the updated PW
[2020-12-10, 11:30:26 AM] Jamie: Cool
[2020-12-14, 12:29:21 PM] Rob Feeny: Just bought a 2000 Tacoma 😬
[2020-12-14, 12:29:33 PM] Jamie: Nice dude! Pics?
‎[2020-12-14, 12:50:46 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-12-14, 12:50:48 PM] Rob Feeny: Got it for $8500
[2020-12-14, 2:01:15 PM] Jamie: Looks sweet Rob. Cant wait to see what you do with it
[2020-12-14, 2:05:56 PM] Jamie: What are you doing with the car?
[2020-12-14, 2:08:35 PM] Rob Feeny: Sheila will get the car. It's still in amazing shape
[2020-12-14, 2:11:23 PM] Jamie: Haha so 3 vehicles and 3 motorcycles?  I guess 4 with your house truck
[2020-12-14, 2:21:59 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha yep but one motorcycle is for sale and the other will go away in the spring.
[2020-12-14, 2:22:15 PM] Rob Feeny: I'll probably sell the car to Sheila for 2k and put it in her name
[2020-12-20, 6:52:49 PM] Jamie: Get your truck yet?
[2020-12-20, 6:53:28 PM] Rob Feeny: Been cleaning and polishing it for 2 days 🤣
[2020-12-20, 6:53:39 PM] Jamie: Got more pics?
‎[2020-12-20, 6:53:43 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-12-20, 6:54:31 PM] Jamie: Probably one of the most boring pics ever. Thanks haha
[2020-12-20, 6:55:04 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha I was on a ladder
[2020-12-20, 6:55:13 PM] Rob Feeny: Taking off the excess wax from coat #2

[2020-12-20, 7:57:59 PM] Jamie: Nice looking truck!
‎[2020-12-20, 8:27:47 PM] Rob Feeny: ‎image omitted
[2020-12-20, 8:27:51 PM] Rob Feeny: Now it's shiny!
[2020-12-20, 8:27:54 PM] Rob Feeny: Thanks!
[2020-12-20, 9:03:50 PM] Jamie: My dream is to have a truck similar to that but with a flat deck. Then modular components depending on the purpose.  Unloaded it’s super light and efficient.
[2020-12-20, 9:14:38 PM] Rob Feeny: Yep loads of one Toyota's with flat decks in the hills
[2020-12-20, 9:14:50 PM] Rob Feeny: Man tho,aside from the canopy, it looks like a new truck!

[2020-12-25, 4:10:18 PM] Rob Feeny: Haha we figured
